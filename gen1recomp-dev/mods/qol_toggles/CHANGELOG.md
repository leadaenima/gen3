# Changelog

## [1.31.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- **INSTANT HATCH (Gen 2)**: A new toggle that hatches any egg in the party on
  your next step.  The engine ticks an egg's counter only on one phase of the
  256-step cycle, so even an egg whose cycles are spent could wait most of a
  further cycle; with the toggle ON the first footfall zeroes the party's first
  egg and the vanilla hatch script runs as usual -- animation, "* came out of
  its EGG!" and the nickname prompt are untouched.  A party of several eggs
  hatches one per step, matching the cart's one-hatch-per-footfall rule.
  Ships OFF.
- **BADGELESS HMs: every FLY destination**: With BADGELESS HMs on, FLY now
  lists every native city/fly point even before you have visited it, on
  Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold alike.  The engine keeps its own region and landing
  rules, and the real save is never marked up to do it -- the visited set is
  cloned just for the list.

### Changed

- **QUICK NURSE on Gold**: The nurse is now found by her sprite, script key or
  object name instead of one hard-coded script key, so the no-dialogue heal
  works at Gold's Pokecenters.  The heal also restores Gold party members
  properly -- HP, status and PP, which the Gen 1 heal path never did for mons
  with no stat block -- and the nurse turns to face the heal machine during the
  animation and back to you when it finishes.

### Fixed

- **NO ENCOUNTER DUPES now covers fishing**: A bite that repeats the previous
  species is re-rolled like a walking encounter (best effort, at most 8 tries)
  instead of fishing sailing past the toggle.  Walking and fishing share the
  one remembered species.
- **EXP BAR growth curves on Gen 2 data**: Growth-rate ids such as
  `MEDIUM_FAST` are normalised before the curve lookup, so Gold's uppercase ids
  resolve to the correct EXP curve instead of the generic formula.
- **A missing optional engine module no longer takes the mod down**: The shop,
  list, bag, quantity-box, overworld and Gen 2 seams now load defensively, and
  the generation is re-resolved when the game is ready, so a module a build
  does not ship (or a generation that is only known at boot) no longer costs
  you the whole toggle set.

## [1.30.8] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- **Fixed Disappearing Held Items (Gen 2)**: Rebuilt the Infinite Held Items system to reliably restore all consumed Berries and battle items when a battle ends. Restores items across party reordering, mid-battle switches, team wipes/blackouts, and direct game saves.

## [1.30.7] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed & Improved

- **Fixed Poison Crash on iOS & Android (Gen 2)**: Fixed an overworld crash when taking poison damage while walking in Gold, Silver, and Crystal.
- **Zero-Delay Menu Toggles**: Eliminated delay and frame stutter when turning toggles on or off in the Options menu by optimizing storage saves.
- **Infinite TMs in Gen 2**: Fixed Unlimited TMs so TMs are never consumed when teaching moves in Gold, Silver, and Crystal.
- **Heal After Battle in Gen 2**: Fixed Heal After Battle to properly restore party HP, status, and PP in Gen 2 battles.
- **Badgeless HMs**: Renamed toggle to *BADGELESS HMs* and updated the START info text to show all Gen 2 HMs (including Waterfall and Whirlpool) when playing Gold, Silver, or Crystal.
- **START Info Texts**: Added START button help popups for *EXP BAR* and *MODERN TYPES*.

## [1.30.6] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- **LIGHTS ON in Crystal**: Fixed Gen 2 engine lineage and version detection for Crystal so the `map.palette` hook and dark cave palette overrides install properly during Crystal's boot.
- **Immediate Palette Refresh**: Toggling `LIGHTS ON` in the Options menu while currently inside a cave or dark area immediately re-bakes and applies the overworld map palettes without needing to re-enter the map.

## [1.30.5] - 2026-08-26

### Changed

- AUTO BATTLER moved into the standalone Auto Battler mod. Existing
  `qol_toggles.auto_battler` settings migrate to the new mod's option bucket
  when no explicit `auto_battler.enabled` value exists.

## [1.30.4] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Gen 2 detection now trusts the live game owner during boot and ignores
  leftover Gen 2 namespaces on a reused Gen 1 data table.

## [1.30.3] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- AUTO BATTLER now recognizes Crystal from the live Gen 2 game data during
  boot, so the toggle selects and submits Palace-style moves in Crystal
  battles even when the process-wide version value is briefly stale.

## [1.30.2] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Gen 2 detection now recognizes Silver and Crystal, so their native QOL
  compatibility paths install correctly.
- ALWAYS CATCH now uses the shared Gen 2 catch-rate hook and guarantees catches
  in Silver and Crystal.
- UNLIMITED TMs now preserves teaching machines in Silver and Crystal.
- Gen 2 install guards are cleared on mod reload, preventing stale hooks.

## [1.30.1] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- EXP BAR now detects wide battle layouts and anchors its fill at the right
  edge of the player's wide HUD (`x = 291`), preventing a stray 2D pixel line
  from being rendered over the 3D battle diorama.

## [1.30.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Gold compatibility for the complete toggle set. Gold now keeps every row
  visible and routes the previously Gen 1-only behaviors through its native
  BattleState, MartMenu, Game2 item flow, SummaryMenu, Gen2Compat talk seam,
  map palette seam and script-backed world data: QUICK SHIP, LAST ITEM,
  POKEBALL BONUS, BULK MART, BULK COINS, LIGHTS ON, AUTO BATTLER, EXP BAR,
  PARTY SCROLL and FORGETTABLE HMs.
- The Gen 2 checker is clean of compatibility errors; the remaining notes are
  dynamic-require/static-analysis notes or documented Gold input behavior.
- Added the Gen 2-only INFINITE HELD ITEM toggle: consumed party held items
  are restored after battle, never during the battle.

## [1.29.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- SAND FREE: a new toggle that stops wild Pokémon from ever using
  SAND-ATTACK.  When a wild enemy would roll SAND-ATTACK, its move choice is
  re-rolled from its other usable moves instead (max 8 attempts); a wild mon
  whose only usable move is SAND-ATTACK Struggles rather than throw sand, so
  the move is never used against you in a wild battle.
  - Wild battles only: trainer battles keep their vanilla AI untouched.
  - The move is not removed from the wild mon's moveset, so a caught
    Sandshrew, Pidgey or Geodude still knows it for your own use.
  - Works on Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold alike: one wrap over the engine's
    battle.enemy_action choke point (BattleState:enemyAction on Gen 1,
    Battle:enemyMove on Gen 2) covers both generations.
  - Ships OFF.  Toggle it in OPTIONS → QOL TOGGLES.

## [1.28.1] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- ANIM SKIP: extended to overworld item events (e.g. "Red got Oak's Parcel",
  found items, gifted items, Key Items, TMs/HMs) and fanfare textboxes,
  allowing pressing A to immediately skip the item fanfare and advance/close
  the textbox without waiting for the audio to finish.

## [1.28.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- ANIM SKIP: a new toggle that lets the player skip battle animations,
  Pokémon cries, and level up/learning jingles by pressing A during battle:
  - Battle animations: pressing A immediately completes the move animation,
    applies damage/hit effects, and advances the turn without waiting.
  - Pokémon cries: entrance cries and battle cries are force-stopped on A-press,
    instantly unblocking the battle queue.
  - Level up & jingles: level up messages, fanfares, and move learning jingles
    can be dismissed immediately with A.
  - Audio overlap prevention: whenever audio overlap would occur, the first
    sound is force-stopped before the next sound begins playing, eliminating
    audio stacking.
  - Works on Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold. Ships OFF.

## [1.27.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- INSTANT TEXT: a new toggle that types all dialogue and menus out at once
  instead of the engine's typewriter pace, overriding the TEXT SPEED
  setting entirely.  The down-arrow / page prompts still gate on A like the
  cart.  One wrap over the shared TextBox (src/render/TextBox.lua) covers
  both Red and Gold.  Ships OFF.
- HOLD TO SCROLL: a new toggle that adds hold-to-repeat to menu scrolling,
  so holding Up or Down (and Left/Right on the QOL TOGGLES card grid) keeps
  stepping instead of tapping per step.  Enables the engine's opt-in
  ListMenu/ScriptMenu keyRepeat through the ui.list_menu hook (bag, shop,
  box, Pokédex), and drives the generic Gen 1 Menu boxes, both OPTIONS
  screens and the QOL TOGGLES submenu through a shared holdNav helper.
  Works on Red and Gold alike.  Ships OFF.

## [1.26.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- PARTY SCROLL: a new toggle allowing the player to press Up and Down in the
  Pokémon STATS / Summary screen (`SummaryMenu`) to cycle through party
  Pokémon without closing the screen, updating the sprite, stats and cry while
  retaining the active page (Page 1: Stats, Page 2: Moves & EXP). Ships ON.
- EXP BAR: a new toggle rendering an animated, Gen 2-style battle experience
  bar below the player's HP bar in Gen 1 battles, filling the arrow/underline
  groove in solid black as the active Pokémon earns EXP towards its next level.
  Smoothly animates during battle, loops through level-ups, and shows a full
  bar at Level 100. Ships OFF (Gen 1 only; Gold natively renders its own EXP bar).
- MAP LOCATION: added horizontal ticker text and extended display duration
  for long map and building names (like ROCK TUNNEL POKECENTER) that exceed
  the toast window width.

### Changed

- QUICK NURSE: updated to play the healing machine animation and sound while
  skipping all dialogue (welcome, yes/no prompt, fighting fit, farewell), then
  automatically turning the player away from the counter.
- MODERN TYPES: fixed Fire resisting Ice (Ice vs Fire = 0.5x resisted) in
  Gen 1, injecting the modern matchup row into the type chart.

## [1.24.1] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- B FOR QUICK FLEE no longer jumps the battle menu cursor to RUN in
  trainer battles, where neither engine allows running.  The toggle
  still works in wild battles; the exclusion covers both the Gen 1
  battle state (kind/trainer fields) and the Gen 2 battle model (the
  screen's `.battle` table).

## [1.24.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- MODERN TYPES: the Gen VI+ type chart (minus FAIRY) replaces the cart's
  chart.  On Red/Blue/Yellow it fixes the three Gen 1-only quirks -- GHOST
  hits PSYCHIC super effectively (the famous Gen 1 pointer bug made it
  immune), BUG no longer beats POISON, and POISON no longer beats BUG.  On
  Gold the only change is the Gen VI update where STEEL stopped resisting
  GHOST and DARK.  Every other matchup is already identical, so the toggle
  swaps just those rows; the vanilla chart is snapshotted and restored on
  OFF.  Works on Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold.  Ships OFF.

- Thanks to [@ProprietaryWeakness](https://github.com/ProprietaryWeakness)
  for suggesting the MODERN TYPES toggle.

## [1.23.1] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed

- PERFECT DVS now applies to scripted-gift Pokémon too (the starter, the
  Celadon Eevee, Game Corner prizes, fossils), not just captures.  Gen 1
  arms the latch on pokemon.before_give; Gold arms it on the givepoke
  script command, and the wrapped mon constructors consume it, so a gift
  gets 15s across the board with stats recomputed and sits at full HP.

## [1.23.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- QUICK NURSE: talking to a Pokécenter nurse heals instantly -- no
  welcome dialogue, no yes/no, no machine animation -- and the player
  turns away automatically.  The nurse still faces you, the center is
  remembered as the last-heal point, and the Pewter Pikachu sleep scene
  keeps its vanilla dialogue (it is a story beat, not a heal).  On Red
  the nurse's whole TX_SCRIPT interaction is replaced; on Gold the
  A-press dispatch is intercepted before the shared PokecenterNurseScript
  can start, so the party heals with no script at all.  Ships OFF.

## [1.22.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- MONEY MULT: battle earnings scale by a selectable multiplier (0x,
  1.5x, 2x, 3x or 4x) -- trainer prize money and Pay Day both.  The
  victory and "picked up" texts print the scaled figure; at 0x the
  prize line is dropped entirely (no "You got ¥0" box) and Pay Day is
  cancelled.  Works on Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold (Gold scales the prize
  through its Prize.award module).  Ships OFF.

### Changed

- EXP x2 becomes EXP MULT: the toggle now cycles 0x, 1.5x, 2x, 3x and
  4x instead of a fixed double.  Fractions floor like the cart's EXP
  splits, and the "gained N EXP" text shows the scaled amount.  A save
  that already set the old toggle reads as 2x, so nothing is lost.
  Still ships OFF.

## [1.21.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- RENAME: the party submenu gains a RENAME row that opens the naming
  screen for the selected Pokémon, so nicknames can be changed on the
  fly without visiting the Name Rater.  The current nickname pre-fills
  and an empty or unchanged confirm keeps it, the Name Rater's own
  decline rule.  The row never appears in battle or on an egg, and when
  the eight-row submenu box is full the CANCEL row (then the last
  field-move row) gives up its seat so RENAME stays visible.  Works on
  Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold.  Ships ON.

## [1.20.1] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Added compatibility with the upcoming Grandma's Kitchen update and its
  sandboxed mod runtime. Toggle settings now use the public mod options API
  and scoped mod storage instead of opening the engine's raw options
  filesystem.
- The development test runner no longer uses environment-variable access, so
  the repository passes the same sandbox audit as the shipped mod.

## [1.20.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- The QOL TOGGLES menu now uses a paginated 2×2 card layout, showing four
  switches at a time.
- The D-pad moves between cards, A toggles the selected switch, B exits, and
  START or P opens the selected switch's help text.

### Changed

- Long card labels keep whole words together. Individual lines that are too
  wide now scroll horizontally inside their card instead of splitting words
  across lines.
- The battle shortcut is labelled B FOR QUICK FLEE for clarity.

## [1.19.1] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- B TO RUN works on Gold. The toggle reads the battle cursor at the menu
  root, but Gold's battle screen keeps the active Pokemon on the battle
  model (battle.battle.player) instead of Gen 1's battle.player.mon, so
  the guard bailed on every Gold battle and B never moved the cursor
  (issue #11).  Gold's tutorial and Bug Contest menus are now skipped the
  same way the old man's demo and Safari are on Red.
- The Gen 2 field-move submenu no longer overflows the screen.  A Pokemon
  that can learn more field moves than the menu can render (Feraligatr's
  CUT/SURF/STRENGTH/WATERFALL/WHIRLPOOL/ROCK_SMASH, for example) pushed
  rows past the top border of the party menu (issue #10).  Phantom rows
  now respect the cart's own eight-row limit: they displace the CANCEL
  row first, then the excess is trimmed -- the same rule the cart applies
  to a full moveset.  Gen 1's party menu is capped the same way (the
  cart's four-move field-row maximum).

### Added

- TURN AWAY (NURSE).  A new toggle makes the player turn away from the
  counter after a Pokecenter heal, so mashing A walks you off instead of
  locking you back into the nurse's dialogue (issue #12).  Ships OFF.
  On Red the turn rides the end of the nurse's farewell dialogue; on Gold
  it fires when the nurse's map script ends, and the Elm's-lab and
  Hall-of-Fame heal machines are left alone.

## [1.19.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- B TO RUN. A new toggle makes B at the root of the battle menu move the
  cursor to RUN; A still confirms the escape. Vanilla Gen 1 has no B branch
  at the menu root (B only backs out of move select), so the shortcut takes
  nothing away. It rides the shared `BattleState.update` seam on both
  generations and never fires in the old man's demo battle, a Safari battle,
  a link or spectated battle, or while a locked action (Thrash, Rage,
  recharge) owns the turn. Ships OFF.

## [1.18.2] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- CATCH GIVES EXP works on Gold. Catching a Pokémon now awards the EXP you
  earned for the capture — the bar crawl, "grew to level" lines, move-learn
  prompts and post-battle evolution all show as they do on Red. Previously a
  Gold capture paid zero EXP because the engine never consulted the hook the
  toggle uses.
- FIELD MOVES ALL works on Gold. The party menu now lists field moves your
  Pokémon can learn but hasn't learned yet, not just the ones it already
  knows. The same HM ITEM REQUIRED and badge rules as Red apply, and Gold's
  Waterfall and Whirlpool are recognized as HM items.
- POISON SAVE works on Gold. A poisoned Pokémon no longer faints from step
  damage while the toggle is on — it is clamped at 1 HP just like on Red.
  Previously the toggle had no effect on Gold because it didn't recognize
  Gold's status spellings.
- Toggle settings persist across restarts on Gold. Flipping a toggle in the
  QOL TOGGLES submenu and restarting no longer resets your choices — they are
  saved on both generations.

## [1.18.1] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- UNLIMITED TMs is back on Gold. The first 1.18.0 Gen 2 port shipped it
  gated to Gen 1 — the toggle was missing from the QOL TOGGLES submenu on a
  Gold boot — because Gold's TM teach consumes the machine through
  `Game2:consumeItem` rather than Gen 1's `ItemEffects.use`. It now works on
  both generations: on Gen 2 the toggle skips `Game2:consumeItem` for a TM
  (an item whose record teaches a move, non-HM) while it is on, so the
  machine is kept; off, HMs and non-TM items consume exactly as vanilla.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Gold (Gen 2) support. The manifest now declares `"games": ["gen1",
  "gen2"]`, and the toggles that have a Gen 2 home are ported to Gold's
  second engine: POISON SAVE (wraps `StepEvents.poisonStep`), HEAL ON MAP
  CHANGE (wraps `gen2.World:setMap`), AUTO-REPEL (wraps
  `StepEvents.repelStep`), the AUTO-REPEL / MAP LOCATION toast (draws via
  the `render.hud` hook), KEEP MONEY (snapshot on `battle.ended`),
  AUTO CUT (wraps `gen2.Player:tryMove` + `FieldMoves.tryCutOW`),
  ALWAYS CATCH (wraps `gen2.Catching.attempt(opts)`), REMEMBER CURSOR /
  REMEMBER MOVE (reset the Gen 2 battle screen's menu/move cursors), FULL
  HEAL CATCH / PERFECT DVS / HEAL AFTER BATTLE (Gen 2 Mon's heal/stat
  shapes), FIELD MOVES ALL / BADGELESS MOVES (Gen 2's
  `save.player.badges` gate), and UNLIMITED TMs (Gen 2's
  `Game2:consumeItem` skips teaching TMs while the toggle is on). The
  submenu renders its rows on Gold without the Gen 1-only OptionRows module.
- The toggles that are Gen 1-cart mechanics Gold does not have — QUICK
  S.S. ANNE, BULK COINS, LIGHTS ON, MOUSE CAM LOCK, LAST ITEM (M),
  AUTO BATTLER, POKEBALL BONUS, BULK MART and FORGETTABLE HMs — no longer
  appear in the QOL TOGGLES submenu on a Gold boot (they stay on
  Red/Blue/Yellow). Gold's mart, battle-item and HM-forget APIs are
  structurally different, so those toggles have no honest Gen 2 equivalent
  yet.

## [1.17.2] - 2026-08-07

### Changed

- AUTO BATTLER: a Pokémon with no usable moves (all PP spent) now
  Struggles like vanilla Gen 1 instead of skipping the turn with the
  "is incapable of using its power!" message — the same action shape the
  engine's own no-PP path and trainer AI use, recoil included.  The
  incapability message can no longer appear in normal play.

## [1.17.1] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- AUTO BATTLER no longer spams "is incapable of using its power!": the
  move grouping now classifies Gen 1 self-targeting moves (stat boosts,
  recovery, Substitute, Splash, Transform, Conversion, Mist, Light
  Screen, Reflect, Focus Energy) as the Palace's Defense category via
  their effect field.  The extractor omits the ROM target data Emerald's
  GetBattlePalaceMoveGroup groups by, which left Defense structurally
  empty — every Defense roll (and Support rolls on all-attack movesets)
  hit the empty-category 50% incapability roll and wasted the turn.  An
  empty category now falls back to a usable move instead; the Emerald
  turn-skip remains available to callers that explicitly ask for it.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- AUTO BATTLER: when enabled, the player's Pokémon chooses its own move
  using the Pokémon Emerald Battle Palace's Attack / Defense / Support
  category probabilities, including the below-half-HP table and the
  category-missing fallback. The selected category is passed through Gen 1's
  normal AI scoring. Because Gen 1 has no Nature field, a transparent
  approximate Palace style is derived from the four Gen 1 DVs and stat EXP.
  Trainer AI, items, switching, and forced multi-turn actions remain
  unchanged. Ships OFF.
- MAP LOCATION: entering a new area shows its name in the AUTO-REPEL
  toast style (non-modal, fades out on its own), with the town map's
  names and a corrected name for the Route 10 PokeCenter (the town map
  data calls it "ROCK TUNNEL").  Ships ON.

### Notes

- The Emerald source keeps the original Palace category table in
  `src/battle_script_commands.c` and the chooser in
  `src/battle_gfx_sfx_util.c`; the Gen 1 port preserves those thresholds but
  maps each mon's DV/stat-EXP spread to an approximate style. Emerald does
  not define a DV-to-Nature mapping, so this part is intentionally a mod
  design approximation. Emerald's exact static target metadata is not
  exposed by the current Gen 1 extractor, so move grouping uses the closest
  available target/effect representation. The low-HP profile latches until
  switch-out. An empty selected category follows Emerald's random fallback,
  50% incapability roll, and incapability message; turning the toggle off
  preserves the originally selected Gen 1 action.

- The engine's existing `battle.enemy_action` hook remains trainer-side;
  AUTO BATTLER is installed through a guarded player-side `BattleState.update`
  wrapper, while items, switches, link battles, and locked multi-turn actions
  remain on their existing paths. The wrapper marks its own resolution to
  avoid selecting twice if the battle update is re-entered by a caller.

## [1.16.4] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- Start menu compatibility with Gen1 Modern UI: the auto-repel toast wrapped
  `OverworldState.draw`, which Gen1 Modern UI's `presentationStack` treats as
  proof that the released overworld renderer was replaced — disabling its
  overworld presenter, and with it every menu layered over the overworld
  (StartMenu included). The toast now draws through the additive
  `OverworldState.drawUI` overlay seam, which Gen1 Modern UI explicitly
  sanctions for location banners, so the stock `draw` (and its identity)
  survives untouched and the Start menu opens normally. No Gen1 Modern UI
  change is required — QoL Toggles also leaves `Game:gamepadpressed`
  dispatch untouched, so the engine opens the native Start menu on
  controller START with Gen1 Modern UI enabled.

## [1.16.1] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- Fixed controller START handling so the overworld Start menu remains visible
  when QoL Toggles is enabled.
- Stored the QUICK S.S. ANNE prompt flag per save instead of globally, so
  separate save files no longer share progress.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- BULK COINS: the Celadon Game Corner clerk greets you, asks
  "Would you like to purchase some COINS?" and offers 50, 500 or
  9,999 coins at a time (¥1000 / ¥10000 / ¥199980, the vanilla
  20¥-per-coin rate) instead of the fixed 50, plus a CUSTOM row that
  opens a four-box digit picker (up/down cycles each digit 0-9,
  left/right moves between boxes) for any amount from 1 to 9,999.
  Tiers that would overflow the 9,999 coin cap drop out of the list,
  and with the toggle OFF the clerk is byte-for-byte vanilla.  Ships
  OFF.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- NO ENCOUNTER DUPES: a wild roll never gives the same species twice in
  a row (re-rolled until it differs, best effort on single-species
  areas).  Ships OFF.
- INSTANT FISH: the rod always bites on the first try — the candidate
  group is uniform-picked instead of run through the rejection loop.
  Maps with no fishing group still have nothing to catch; the Old
  Rod's always-catch is unchanged.  Ships OFF.
- HEAL AFTER BATTLE: every battle that ends (win, run, catch, loss)
  fully heals the party — HP, status, all PP.  Ships OFF.
- AUTO-REPEL: a worn-off repel is replaced from the bag automatically,
  strongest first (MAX > SUPER > plain), announced by an on-screen
  toast — the usual "effect wore off" text is skipped when a refill
  happens, and with nothing left it just wears off.  Ships ON.
- BULK MART: mart quantity prompts (BUY and SELL) open at 10 instead
  of 1, still capped by money and bag space; the mod manager's numeric
  option boxes are untouched.  Ships OFF.
- LIGHTS ON: dark caves and tunnels render fully lit, no FLASH needed
  (FLASH itself still works and is harmless).  Ships OFF.
- REMEMBER MOVE: the FIGHT move cursor stays on the last move used
  across turns, the sibling of REMEMBER CURSOR; OFF restores the
  vanilla first-move default.  Ships ON.
- KEEP MONEY: blacking out no longer costs half your money, from
  poison steps or a battle loss.  Ships OFF.
- AUTO CUT: walking into a cut tree cuts it when a party mon knows
  CUT, with exactly the vanilla tileset/block/CUT gates; the player
  stays put while the text and animation play.  FIELD MOVES ALL does
  not extend to auto-cut.  Ships OFF.
- RUN (HOLD B): hold B to move twice as fast on foot; the bike and
  surfing keep their own speeds.  Ships OFF.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- MOUSE CAM LOCK: with Dramatic Shape Voxel Mod installed, the battle
  camera no longer follows the mouse.  Only the mouse steering is cut --
  the right stick, a touch drag and the zoom still work.  The toggle is
  inert (nothing to gate) when Dramatic Shape is absent.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- FORGETTABLE HMs did nothing on engine builds v0.1.59..v0.1.63: those
  builds ran the old ChoiceBox forget flow, where MoveLearnMenu never
  sets the `selecting` field the toggle gated on, so the gate-free
  update never engaged and the vanilla "HM techniques can't be
  deleted!" message appeared even with the toggle ON.  The toggle now
  treats a missing `selecting` (old flow) as "forget list live", so
  teaching any move over an HM works on every engine build.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-08-04

### Changed

- The OPTIONS row is renamed from USEFUL TOGGLES to QOL TOGGLES, matching
  the mod's name everywhere (README, mod card, index).

## [1.11.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- POKEBALL BONUS: a toggle that, when ON, earns a free GREAT BALL every
  time you buy your tenth POKé BALL at any mart — in one purchase or
  across several, since the counter is cumulative and stored with the
  save.  The clerk announces it: "Thanks for your support, please take
  this free Great Ball."  Only balls actually bought count (Oak's five
  starter balls and found balls never do, because the bonus keys off the
  mart's BUY screen).  Ships OFF.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- LAST ITEM (M): a toggle that, when ON, makes M in battle use the last
  item you used from the bag — balls throw at the foe, healing opens the
  party screen so you pick the mon (ETHERs/PP UP then ask for the move),
  targetless battle items (X items, POKé FLUTE, POKé DOLL) work as usual.
  A failed use shows the vanilla refusal text and does not spend the
  turn; with nothing remembered the bag opens.  M is detected by and
  rebindable from the Mods Hotkeys submenu.  Ships OFF.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- CATCH GIVES EXP: capturing a wild Pokémon pays out the same EXP its
  defeat would — split among the mons that fought, with stat exp, traded
  boosts, level-ups and the "gained N EXP" announcement.  Ships OFF.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- START on a controller (or P on the keyboard) on any toggle row opens a
  full-screen help popup (the Mods Hotkeys capture idiom) with an in-depth
  explanation of what that toggle does.  B or another START/P closes it;
  B still exits the submenu.
- A description taller than the popup box scrolls vertically, slowly
  (one line per second, holding at each end), scissored to the box so it
  never bleeds over the border.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Toggle labels longer than the row's label window now scroll as a ticker
  (hold at the start, scroll to the end, hold, scroll back — the
  MoveRelearn name ticker) instead of bleeding over the box border.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-08-03

### Changed

- UNLIMITED TMs/HMs splits into two switches: UNLIMITED TMs (TMs teach
  without breaking) and FORGETTABLE HMs (HM moves can be forgotten when
  a Pokémon learns a new move).  Both ship ON.

### Added

- HM ITEM REQUIRED: the FIELD MOVES ALL extras for HM moves (CUT, FLY,
  SURF, STRENGTH, FLASH) only appear once the player holds the HM item
  -- no CUT on the Cascade Badge alone when the CUT HM is still on the
  S.S. Anne.  Applies to the party-menu list and the use-time
  eligibility both; moves a Pokémon already knows are never gated, and
  item-less field moves (DIG, TELEPORT, SOFTBOILED) are unaffected.
  Ships ON.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- REMEMBER CURSOR: the battle FIGHT/BAG/PKMN/RUN cursor stays where it
  was left across turns (use BAG to heal, and the cursor is still on
  BAG next turn).  OFF restores the vanilla fresh-FIGHT default at the
  end of every turn.  Ships ON.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- UNLIMITED TMs/HMs: TMs teach their move without breaking, and HM
  moves can be forgotten when a Pokémon learns a new move.  Ships ON.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Using an Ether, Max Ether or PP Up on a Pokémon no longer crashes the
  game when FIELD MOVES ALL is on: phantom field-move slots were being
  attached to the target picker's moveset, and the "Which move?" list
  tripped on their missing PP (blue screen, BagMenu "number expected,
  got nil").  Target pickers are now exempt from phantom moves and badge
  injection.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- QUICK S.S. ANNE: the Vermilion dock sailor prompts for the ticket once;
  every later pass onto the gangway walks straight through with no
  dialogue and no stop.  The ship-left guard and the no-ticket walk-back
  stay vanilla.  Ships OFF.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- HEAL ON MAP CHANGE: every map transition (routes, caves, warps,
  connections, boot) fully heals the party — HP, status, and all PP.
  Ships OFF.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- FIELD MOVES ALL no longer bypasses badge gates at use time: on engine
  builds without a list-time badge check in the party menu, a mon that
  could learn Surf/Cut could use it without the badge or the HM.  The
  fieldmove.eligibility wrap now applies the hmBadges gate itself
  (FLY/CUT need their badge, SURF needs the Soul Badge, STRENGTH the
  Rainbow Badge, FLASH the Boulder Badge) unless BADGELESS MOVES is on.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Blue screen on Route 13 while surfing: another mod's encounter patch
  can leave a map's water/grass def without a `rate`, which crashed the
  encounter roll mid-step.  The encounter.roll wrap now degrades a
  throwing roll to "no encounter" (logged) instead of crashing the game.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- BADGELESS MOVES: FLY / SURF / CUT / STRENGTH / FLASH work without
  their badges — the party-menu list and the use-time gates both (the
  engine's own fieldmove.eligibility hook, which also lets FIELD MOVES
  ALL surf-mount and cut trees with a mon that only can learn the move).
- ALWAYS CATCH: every ball catches, Master Ball style (full three-shake
  chain).
- PERFECT DVS: caught Pokémon get 15s across the board; stats are
  recomputed to match.
- EXP x2: double battle EXP via the engine's exp.gain hook — the gain
  text shows the doubled amount too.
- INSTANT FLEE: wild battles always escape on the first try, via the
  engine's battle.run hook (RUN menu and the faint dialogue's NO
  branch).
- All five ship OFF by default; the original four keep their defaults.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- POISON SAVE, FULL HEAL CATCH and FIELD MOVES ALL now ship ON by default;
  INFINITE REPEL still ships OFF.  A stored toggle always wins over the
  default, so existing settings are untouched.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Toggles now persist: they live in options.lua (the mod-options bucket the
  mod manager uses) instead of the per-save modData, which NEW GAME and
  CONTINUE replace outright.  A toggle flipped from the title screen used
  to be silently discarded on start/continue, and an unsaved session lost
  it on quit; both are gone now.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- FIELD MOVES ALL actually works: the party menu builds its field-move
  list before the ui.party.submenu hook fires, so the phantom moves are
  now attached to the selected Pokémon before the vanilla update runs
  (wrapping PartyMenu.update instead).  Badge gates and context rules
  still apply exactly as before.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- FIELD MOVES ALL: any Pokémon that can learn a field move (level-up or
  TM/HM) can use it out of battle even without knowing it — Pidgey can FLY,
  Clefable can TELEPORT.  Badge gates and context rules (FLY/TELEPORT
  outdoors, FLASH in the dark, DIG's tilesets) apply exactly as for a known
  move.

### Changed

- The OPTIONS row is now USEFUL TOGGLES, with the on-count shown as a
  running total (e.g. "2/4 ON").

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- OPTIONS → TOGGLES submenu with three per-save switches.
- POISON SAVE: poisoned party members survive at 1 HP; the poison subsides with "X's poison has subsided!".
- FULL HEAL CATCH: captured Pokémon are fully healed (HP, status, PP) in the party or a PC box.
- INFINITE REPEL: blocks all wild walking encounters while active.
