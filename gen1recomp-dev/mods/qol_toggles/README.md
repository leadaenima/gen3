# QoL Toggles

Adds a QOL TOGGLES row to OPTIONS that opens a submenu with quality-of-life switches, each persisted with your save. Works on Red/Blue/Yellow **and Gold**: every toggle is available on both generations, using Gold's native battle, mart, script, world and summary-screen seams where the engines differ.

## Try it

```sh
# 1. install: copy the folder into the game's mods/ directory
cp -r mods/qol_toggles <game-dir>/mods/

# 2. run the game, open OPTIONS, and pick QOL TOGGLES
love .
```

## The switches

- **POISON SAVE** — when a poisoned party member would faint from
  out-of-battle poison damage, it survives at 1 HP and the poison
  subsides: *"X's poison has subsided!"*
- **FULL HEAL CATCH** — every captured Pokémon is fully healed (HP,
  status, and all PP), whether it joins your party or goes to a PC box.
- **INFINITE REPEL** — no wild encounters while walking through grass,
  surfing, or in caves.  Fishing is unaffected, like the vanilla Repel
  item.
- **FIELD MOVES ALL** — any Pokémon that can learn a field move
  (level-up or TM/HM) can use it out of battle even without knowing it:
  a Pidgey that never learned FLY can still FLY, a Clefable without
  TELEPORT can still TELEPORT.  Badge restrictions still apply — no FLY
  without the Thunder Badge, no SURF without the Soul Badge — and the
  usual context rules hold (FLY/TELEPORT only outdoors, FLASH only in
  the dark, DIG only on its tilesets).  The field-move submenu keeps the
  cart's own eight-row limit, so a Pokémon that can learn many field
  moves never pushes rows off the screen — the extras simply don't fit,
  exactly like a full moveset on the cart.
- **BADGELESS HMs** — the badge gates come off: FLY, SURF, CUT,
  STRENGTH and FLASH (plus WATERFALL and WHIRLPOOL on Gen 2) work without
  their badges.  FLY also lists every native city/fly point even before you
  have visited it, while the engine keeps its normal region and landing rules.
  Pairs with FIELD MOVES ALL for a no-badge, no-moveset run.
- **HM ITEM REQUIRED** — the FIELD MOVES ALL extras for HM moves only
  appear once you actually hold the HM item: no CUT on the Cascade Badge
  alone when the CUT HM is still on the S.S. Anne.  (Moves a Pokémon
  already knows are never affected; non-HM moves like DIG and TELEPORT
  have no item to require.)
- **UNLIMITED TMs** — TMs teach their move without breaking.
- **FORGETTABLE HMs** — HM moves can be forgotten when a Pokémon learns
  a new move.
- **ALWAYS CATCH** — every ball catches, Master Ball style (the ball is
  still consumed).
- **PERFECT DVS** — caught and scripted-gift Pokémon (the starter, the
  Celadon Eevee, Game Corner prizes, fossils) get 15s across the board,
  the gen 1 maximum, with their stats recomputed to match.
- **EXP MULT** — battle EXP scaled by a selectable multiplier: 0x (earn
  nothing), 1.5x, 2x, 3x or 4x.  The "gained N EXP" text shows the
  scaled amount; fractions floor the way the cart floors EXP splits.
  OFF is vanilla.  (The old fixed EXP x2 toggle becomes this selector;
  a save that already set it keeps its 2x.)
- **MONEY MULT** — battle earnings scaled the same way: 0x, 1.5x, 2x, 3x
  or 4x.  Covers trainer prize money and Pay Day; the victory and
  "picked up" texts show the scaled figure, and at 0x the prize line is
  dropped entirely — no "You got ¥0" box — and Pay Day is cancelled.
  OFF is vanilla.
- **CATCH GIVES EXP** — capturing a wild Pokémon pays out the same EXP
  its defeat would: split among the mons that fought, with stat exp,
  traded boosts, level-ups and the "gained N EXP" announcement.
- **INSTANT FLEE** — wild battles always escape on the first try (RUN
  menu and the faint dialogue's NO branch).
- **REMEMBER CURSOR** — the battle FIGHT/BAG/PKMN/RUN cursor stays where
  you left it across turns: use BAG to heal one turn, and the cursor is
  still on BAG the next.  OFF restores the vanilla fresh-FIGHT default
  every turn.
- **B FOR QUICK FLEE** — press B at the root of the battle menu and the cursor
  jumps straight to RUN; A then confirms the escape.  (Vanilla B does
  nothing there, so nothing is taken away.)  It never fires in the old
  man's demo battle (Gold's tutorial), a Safari battle (Gold's Bug
  Contest), a link or spectated battle, a trainer battle, or while a
  locked action like Thrash or recharge owns the turn.  Works on Red and
  Gold alike — Gold's battle screen keeps the active Pokémon on its battle
  model, which the toggle now reads too.
- **HEAL ON MAP CHANGE** — every map transition (routes, caves, warps,
  connections, even boot) fully heals the party: HP, status, and all
  PP.
- **QUICK SHIP** — the Gen 1 Vermilion sailor, or Gold's Fast Ship
  gangway, prompts for your ticket once; after that you board through the
  native warp with no repeated dialogue.  Vanilla departure and ticket
  gates still apply.
- **LAST ITEM (M)** — in battle, press M to use the last item you used
  from the bag: balls throw at the foe, healing (potions, status cures,
  revives, ETHERs) opens the party screen so you pick the mon (ETHERs and
  PP UP then ask for the move), and targetless battle items (X items,
  POKé FLUTE, POKé DOLL) work as usual.  A failed use shows the vanilla
  refusal text and does not spend your turn; with nothing remembered the
  bag opens instead.  The M key is rebindable from the Mods Hotkeys
  submenu, like every other mod hotkey.  Gold uses its native battle-item
  and party-target flow.
- **POKEBALL BONUS** — every time you buy your tenth POKé BALL at any
  mart (in one purchase or across several), the clerk throws in a free
  GREAT BALL: *"Thanks for your support, please take this free Great
  Ball."*  Only balls actually bought count — the five from Professor
  Oak and any found on the ground never do.  The counter carries across
  shops and save sessions on both generations; the toggle ships OFF.
- **NO ENCOUNTER DUPES** — a wild roll never gives the same species
  twice in a row, whether you walked into it or fished it up: the roll is
  re-rolled until it differs (best effort — an area with a single species
  still yields it, and after 8 tries the last roll stands).  Walking and
  fishing share one remembered species.  Session-scoped.
- **INSTANT FISH** — the rod always bites on the first try: the
  candidate group is picked uniformly instead of running the engine's
  rejection loop (bite odds size/(size+4)).  A map with no fishing
  group at all still says "Not even a nibble!" — there is nothing to
  conjure — and the Old Rod's always-catch is unchanged.
- **HEAL AFTER BATTLE** — every battle that ends (win, run, catch,
  loss) fully heals the party: HP, status, and all PP.
- **INFINITE HELD ITEM** — Gen 2 only. If a party Pokémon consumes a held
  item in battle, its original held item returns after the battle. It stays
  consumed for the rest of that battle, so a BERRY can heal once per battle.
  Ships OFF.
- **INSTANT HATCH** — Gen 2 only.  Any egg in your party hatches on your very
  next step, whether it just arrived from the Day-Care or has been carried for
  a while.  The engine only ticks an egg's counter on one phase of its
  256-step cycle, so a spent egg could still sit in the party for most of a
  cycle; with the toggle ON the first footfall zeroes the party's first egg
  and the hatch runs through the engine's own hatch script, so the animation,
  "* came out of its EGG!" and the nickname prompt are all vanilla.  A party
  of several eggs hatches one per step, the cart's own one-hatch-per-footfall
  rule.  Ships OFF.
- **TURN AWAY (NURSE)** — after a Pokécenter nurse heals you, you turn
  away from the counter, so an A-mash walks you off instead of locking
  you back into her dialogue.  The Elm's-lab and Hall-of-Fame heal
  machines are untouched.
- **QUICK NURSE** — talking to a Pokécenter nurse skips all dialogue:
  no welcome dialogue, no yes/no, no farewell — it plays the healing
  machine animation and jingle, and you turn away automatically, so
  tapping A again just walks you off.  The nurse still turns to face you
  when finished, the center is remembered as the last-heal point
  (blackouts and ESCAPE ROPE land there as usual), and the Pewter
  Pikachu sleep scene keeps its vanilla dialogue — it is a story beat,
  not a heal.  Works on Red and Gold alike.
- **AUTO-REPEL** — when a repel wears off, the strongest repel in the
  bag (MAX > SUPER > plain) is used automatically and announced by an
  on-screen toast — the usual "effect wore off" text is skipped when a
  refill happens, and with nothing left to use it just wears off.  The
  toast never blocks — you keep walking while it fades out on its own.
- **BULK MART** — mart quantity prompts (BUY and SELL) open at 10
  instead of 1, still capped by money and bag space.  The mod
  manager's own numeric option boxes are never touched.
- **BULK COINS** — the Game Corner coin clerk greets you, asks
  "Would you like to purchase some COINS?", and offers 50, 500 or
  9,999 coins at a time (¥1000 / ¥10000 / ¥199980 — the vanilla
  20¥-per-coin rate) instead of the fixed 50.  Tiers that would
  overflow the 9,999 coin cap drop out of the list, and a **CUSTOM**
  row opens a four-box digit picker (up/down cycles each digit 0–9,
  left/right moves between boxes) for any amount from 1 to 9,999.
  With the toggle OFF the clerk is exactly vanilla.
- **LIGHTS ON** — dark caves and tunnels render fully lit with no FLASH
  needed; FLASH itself still works and is then harmless.
- **REMEMBER MOVE** — the battle FIGHT move cursor stays where you left
  it across turns (the sibling of REMEMBER CURSOR).  OFF restores the
  vanilla first-move default every turn.
- **KEEP MONEY** — blacking out no longer costs half your money,
  whether the party fell to poison steps or a battle.
- **AUTO CUT** — walk into a cut tree and a party mon that knows CUT
  cuts it for you (the tileset, block-swap and CUT gates are exactly
  the vanilla party-menu ones).  The player stays put while the text
  and animation play.  FIELD MOVES ALL does not extend to auto-cut —
  a mon that merely can learn CUT must still use the party menu.
- **RUN (HOLD B)** — hold B to move twice as fast on foot (bike speed
  without the bike); the bike and surfing keep their own speeds, and
  B does nothing it did not already do in the overworld.
- **MOUSE CAM LOCK** — with the Dramatic Shape Voxel Mod installed, the
  battle camera no longer follows the mouse.  Only the mouse steering is
  cut — the right stick, a touch drag and the zoom still work.  The toggle
  is inert (nothing to gate) when Dramatic Shape is absent.
- **MAP LOCATION** — when ON, entering a new area shows its name in the
  same toast style as AUTO-REPEL's refill banner: a small box near the
  top that fades out on its own while you keep walking.  Names come from
  the town map, with the Route 10 PokeCenter corrected (the town map
  data calls it "ROCK TUNNEL").  Long names (like ROCK TUNNEL POKECENTER)
  smoothly ticker-scroll horizontally so no text is cut off.  Ships ON.
- **RENAME** — the party submenu gains a RENAME row that opens the name
  screen for that Pokémon, so you can rename it on the fly, no Name
  Rater required.  The current nickname pre-fills; an empty or unchanged
  confirm keeps it, exactly the Name Rater's rule.  The row never
  appears in battle or on an egg.  When the submenu's eight-row box is
  already full, the CANCEL row drops first (B still backs out) and then
  the last field-move row gives up its seat, so RENAME is always
  visible.  Works on Red and Gold.
- **MODERN TYPES** — the type chart from Gen VI+ (minus FAIRY, which
  neither generation has) replaces the cart's chart.  On Red/Blue/Yellow
  that fixes the Gen 1 quirks: FIRE resists ICE (neutral in Gen 1),
  GHOST finally hits PSYCHIC super effectively (in Gen 1 the famous pointer
  bug made it immune), BUG stops beating POISON (2x in Gen 1, resisted today)
  and POISON stops beating BUG (2x in Gen 1, neutral today).  On Gold the
  only change is the Gen VI update where STEEL stopped resisting GHOST and
  DARK.  Everything else is already identical, so the toggle swaps and
  adds those rows.  Works on Red and Gold.  Ships OFF.
- **EXP BAR** — shows the native Gold EXP bar below the player's HP bar, or
  renders the matching modern bar on Red/Blue/Yellow, filling as the active
  Pokémon earns EXP toward its next level. Ships OFF.
- **PARTY SCROLL** — in the Pokémon STATS / Summary screen, pressing Up
  and Down cycles through your party Pokémon without closing the screen,
  refreshing the sprite, stats and cry while retaining the page you are on
  (Stats or Moves & EXP). Gold's native summary controls are gated by the
  same toggle. Ships ON.
- **INSTANT TEXT** — dialogue and menus type every glyph out at once
  instead of the typewriter pace, no matter what TEXT SPEED is set to.  The
  down-arrow / page prompts still gate on A like the cart.  Ships OFF.
- **HOLD TO SCROLL** — hold Up or Down (and Left/Right on the QOL TOGGLES
  card grid) to keep scrolling a menu instead of tapping the button for
  every step.  Covers the bag, shop, box and Pokédex lists, the generic
  menu boxes, the OPTIONS screen and the QOL TOGGLES submenu, on Red and
  Gold alike.  Ships OFF.
- **ANIM SKIP** — press A during battle or overworld events to skip move
  animations, Pokémon cries, level up jingles, and item get fanfares (e.g.
  "Red got Oak's Parcel"). In the event of audio overlap, the first sound
  is force-stopped before playing the second sound. Ships OFF.
- **SAND FREE** — wild Pokémon never use SAND-ATTACK.  When a
  wild enemy would roll SAND-ATTACK, its move choice is re-rolled from its
  other usable moves; a wild mon whose only usable move is SAND-ATTACK
  Struggles instead, so it is never used.  Trainer battles are untouched —
  only wild mons are re-rolled — and the move is not removed from the
  moveset, so a caught wild Sandshrew still knows it.  Ships OFF.  Works
  on Red and Gold alike (both route enemy move choice through the
  engine's battle.enemy_action hook).

## Notes

- The QOL TOGGLES submenu shows four switches at a time in a retro 2×2 card
  grid; use the D-pad to move and A to toggle, while B exits.
- Each switch is independent and stored with your preferences (options.lua),
  so toggles survive restarts and save files.  POISON SAVE, FULL HEAL
  CATCH, FIELD MOVES ALL, HM ITEM REQUIRED, UNLIMITED TMs, FORGETTABLE
  HMs, REMEMBER CURSOR, AUTO-REPEL, REMEMBER MOVE, MAP LOCATION,
  RENAME and PARTY SCROLL ship ON; the rest, including EXP BAR, ship OFF.
- Toggling REPEL applies immediately — you can flip it in the field
  without using an item.
- In the 2×2 QOL TOGGLES cards, labels wrap only between whole words. Any
  individual line wider than the card interior ticker-scrolls in place; shorter
  lines stay centered.
- START on a controller (or P on the keyboard) on any toggle row opens a
  full-screen help popup explaining what that toggle does in depth; B (or
  another START/P) closes it, and B still exits the submenu.  A
  description taller than the popup box scrolls vertically, slowly, so
  nothing is ever cut off.
