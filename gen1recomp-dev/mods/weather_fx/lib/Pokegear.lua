-- WEATHER ON THE POKEGEAR.
--
-- Two things, and the first is the one that matters:
--
--   1. An OVERLAY on the vanilla MAP card.  The real town map draws, and
--      the weather is painted on top of it at the real landmark positions.
--   2. A WEATHER strip card: a readable forecast list, for reading numbers
--      rather than shapes.
--
-- =====================================================================
-- WHY THE OVERLAY REPLACED A DRAWN GRID
-- =====================================================================
--
-- The first version of this drew its own 20x14 grid of letters using
-- coordinates invented in `Fronts.REGIONS`.  On a real Pokegear that looked
-- like what it was: symbols floating on an empty panel, in positions that
-- resembled Johto only if you already knew the shape of Johto.
--
-- The engine already knows where every place IS.  `game.data.field.townMap`
-- maps each map id to its square on the town map, and `TownMap.markerXY`
-- converts that to pixels as `x * 8 + 16, y * 8 + 8`.  So the overlay reads
-- those coordinates and paints there, over the actual drawn map, and every
-- marker lands on the town it belongs to because the engine placed it.
--
-- The invented grid survives only as a fallback for a build with no
-- townMap data, where a rough map beats no map.
--
-- =====================================================================
-- DEGRADES FIVE WAYS
-- =====================================================================
--
-- The library may be absent, disabled, or not yet loaded (`mod.find`
-- answers nil for all three); it may be an API version this does not know;
-- and the game may be Gen 1, which has no Pokegear.  Each ends with no card
-- and no error.  A weather mod that refuses to boot without an optional
-- companion would be a worse weather mod.
--
-- Both surfaces are READ-ONLY.  A card that could change the sky would be a
-- weather remote rather than a forecast, and the OPTIONS row already does
-- that job honestly.
