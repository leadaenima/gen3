-- THE PSYSTORM.
--
-- The one weather that is not weather.  It does not roll on the AUTO clock
-- and no front can drift it in; it is SUMMONED, by a place or by what is
-- walking through it, and everywhere else the sky simply cannot produce it.
--
-- Two triggers, either of which is enough:
--
--   1. A MAP WHERE MEWTWO LIVES.  Cerulean Cave and its floors.  The
--      innermost chamber is always storming -- that is its weather, not a
--      chance -- and the approach floors are a strong chance, so walking in
--      feels like walking toward something.
--
--   2. MEW OR MEWTWO AT THE FRONT OF THE PARTY.  Carrying one anywhere
--      makes the sky occasionally answer, which is the version of this a
--      player will actually notice, because most players will never stand
--      in the cave twice.
--
-- WHY IT IS ROLLED PER ARRIVAL, NOT PER FRAME.  A 70% chance evaluated
-- every frame is a certainty within a second, and a chance evaluated per
-- step would flicker.  It is rolled ONCE each time the player enters a
-- qualifying map, and the answer stands until they leave -- the same
-- treatment lib/Config.lua gives a chance-based location override, for the
-- same reason.
--
-- WHY IT OUTRANKS FRONTS.  A front is the region's own weather; a psystorm
-- is a reaction to what is standing there. When Mewtwo's cave is storming
-- and a front says fog, the cave wins -- the front resumes the moment the
-- player leaves, because the front was never overwritten, only overruled.
