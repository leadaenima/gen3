-- THE BIRDS.
--
-- Three weathers that mean something is nearby: a thunderstorm for Zapdos,
-- ashfall for Moltres, hail for Articuno.  Each has a small chance on any
-- outdoor map, and while one is running the bird itself may turn up in the
-- grass.
--
-- =====================================================================
-- WHY THE EXISTING WEATHERS RATHER THAN THREE NEW ONES
-- =====================================================================
--
-- A ZAPDOS_STORM would look exactly like a STORM, need its own catalogue
-- entry, its own battle mapping and its own audio bed, and would then have
-- to be excluded from the AUTO roll so it did not turn up without a bird
-- behind it.  All of that to draw the same rain.
--
-- So a rousing is a FLAG over an ordinary weather, not a weather.  The sky
-- is a real thunderstorm; what makes it Zapdos's thunderstorm is that
-- `Legendary.roused` says so, and that is the only thing the encounter
-- hook needs to know.  Nothing in the draw path, the battle layer or the
-- audio changes at all.
--
-- =====================================================================
-- THE ENCOUNTER IS A SUBSTITUTION, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE
-- =====================================================================
--
-- Everywhere else in this mod an encounter effect REROLLS -- fog draws out
-- a Ghost only if the map already has one, so no table is bypassed.  That
-- rule cannot work here: the whole point is a bird appearing where it
-- normally would not, and no route's table contains Zapdos.
--
-- So this is the one place that substitutes, and it is fenced accordingly:
--
--   * only while that bird's weather is roused, which is itself a 5% roll
--     per map arrival;
--   * once per rousing -- after the bird appears the rousing is spent, so
--     a single storm cannot produce two Zapdos;
--   * never indoors, never in a battle already in progress;
--   * and the level comes from the config rather than from the roll, since
--     a level-3 Zapdos on Route 1 would be worse than none.
--
-- Catching it is the player's business; this mod only decides that it is
-- there.  If they run or faint, the rousing is spent either way -- the
-- storm blew over and the bird moved on, which is the honest reading.
