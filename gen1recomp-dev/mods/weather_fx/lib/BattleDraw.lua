-- WEATHER ON THE BATTLE SCREEN.
--
-- WHY THIS IS NOT THE PRESENT PASS.  Version 1 drew battle weather in the
-- same whole-frame pass as the overworld's, which worked but was wrong in
-- two ways at once: it drew at window resolution over a 160x144 picture
-- that had already been scaled up, so the drops were a different size in
-- battle than outside it; and it landed after the letterbox, so it had to
-- be scissored back to a rectangle the pass had to be told about.
--
-- `battle.overlay` is the hook that exists for this.  It runs at the end
-- of the battle's own draw, INSIDE the 160x144 battle canvas, in that
-- canvas's coordinates.  Drawing here means:
--
--   * one set of coordinates, whatever the window size, the zoom, or the
--     colour mode -- the battle canvas is always 160x144;
--   * the weather is scaled up with the battle, so a raindrop is the same
--     size relative to the sprites as it is relative to the tiles;
--   * it passes through every later stage the engine applies to that
--     canvas -- SGB zone colouring, the palette remap, GBC FX -- so it
--     looks like part of the game rather than like something painted on
--     the glass afterwards;
--   * and it costs nothing at all when no battle is running, because the
--     hook is not called.
--
-- IT DRAWS THE BATTLE'S WEATHER, NOT THE OVERWORLD'S -- and getting that
-- wrong is what made it rain in a gym.  Version 2.3.x read the overworld
-- channels straight off WeatherState, which meant a battle fought inside a
-- building showed whatever the sky outside was doing.  It also meant a
-- Rain Dance cast in that gym showed nothing at all, because the overworld
-- was clear.  Both are the same mistake from opposite ends.
--
-- `battle.field.weather` is the authority, exactly as it is for every
-- battle EFFECT (lib/Battle.lua).  Indoors nothing seeds it, so nothing
-- draws; a move or an ability that sets it makes weather appear wherever
-- the battle is; and the visuals and the damage multipliers can no longer
-- disagree about what the sky is doing, because they read one field.
--
-- The channels are eased locally rather than snapped, so a Rain Dance
-- landing mid-battle rolls in over a second instead of appearing between
-- two frames.
--
-- IT IS DELIBERATELY THINNER THAN THE OVERWORLD'S.  A battle screen is
-- mostly HUD, and HUD has to stay readable: the BATTLES setting scales the
-- whole pass, the particle count is a fraction of the overworld budget,
-- and the ground splashes are dropped entirely (there is no ground). What
-- is kept is what tells the player what the weather IS -- the grade, the
-- haze and the falling water -- because that is the information the battle
-- effects depend on.
