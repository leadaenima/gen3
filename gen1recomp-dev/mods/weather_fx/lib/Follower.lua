-- CHIP DAMAGE OUTSIDE BATTLE.
--
-- Sandstorm, ashfall and hail wear down the Pokemon walking behind you --
-- the same weathers that chip HP in a battle, with the same type
-- immunities, so the rule a player learns in one place holds in the other.
--
-- WHICH POKEMON.  The party LEAD, which is what every follower mod walks
-- behind (Followers EX, the PokePC merge, and the rest all render
-- `Game.save.party[1]`).  Reading the party rather than asking a follower
-- mod is deliberate: it needs no integration, it cannot break when one of
-- them changes, and it does the right thing with no follower mod at all --
-- the Pokemon in the storm is still the one at the front of your party.
--
-- WHY IT CANNOT FAINT BY DEFAULT.  A faint outside battle has no message,
-- no animation and nothing the player can respond to; they would simply
-- notice later that a Pokemon was at zero. So the default clamps at 1 HP:
-- the weather is a cost you can feel and manage, not a silent loss.
-- `canFaint = true` is there for anyone who wants the harsher version.
--
-- IT ONLY RUNS OUTDOORS OR WHERE THE CONFIG SAYS WEATHER REACHES INSIDE.
-- The same rule the draw path uses, from the same function, so a cave
-- with a sandstorm override chips and a Poke Mart never does -- and the
-- two can never disagree, because there is one answer.
