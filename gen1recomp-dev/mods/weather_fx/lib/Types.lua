-- THE WEATHER CATALOGUE.
--
-- This file is the extension point of the whole mod.  Adding a weather type
-- is adding one entry to `Types.list` -- nothing else in the mod knows the
-- name of any weather, and no draw code branches on one.
--
-- THE CHANNEL MODEL is what buys that.  A weather is not a thing with its
-- own renderer; it is a set of numbers, one per visual channel (how much
-- rain, how fast, how dark, how many strikes a minute).  Every draw system
-- reads its own channels and nothing else, and WeatherState eases every
-- channel toward the active type's value at a fixed rate.
--
--   * TRANSITIONS STAY CHANNEL-BASED. Natural AUTO/front handoffs may retain
--     source/target ids briefly so SynopticTransition can stage cloud, wind,
--     precipitation and lightning at different times, but there is still only
--     ONE live channel bag and ONE renderer per effect family. We never keep
--     two weather renderers alive or double a full storm just to cross-fade.
--   * A NEW CHANNEL IS BACKWARD COMPATIBLE.  Channels absent from a def read
--     as 0 (Types.channel), so adding one to a single type does not require
--     touching the other thirteen.
--   * NOTHING CAN DESYNC.  One authority for "how much rain is falling", and
--     it is a number, so an unknown weather id degrades to CLEAR rather than
--     to a half-drawn frame.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- CHANNEL REFERENCE (all plain numbers, all 0 when omitted)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--   rain       0..1  liquid precipitation density
--   rainSpeed  0..2  fall speed multiplier
--   rainAngle  rad   lean off vertical, positive = blown right
--   rainLen    0..2  streak length multiplier
--   splash     0..1  fraction of drops that burst where they land
--   snow       0..1  soft frozen precipitation density
--   snowSpeed  0..2  fall speed multiplier
--   snowDrift  0..1  how much flakes wander sideways
--   hail       0..1  hard frozen grains -- fast, straight, they bounce
--   sand       0..1  wind-driven grit, near-horizontal
--   ash        0..1  volcanic fall -- grey, slow, near-vertical
--   psy        0..1  psychic violet -- an additive wash, not a multiply,
--                    because the sky under a psystorm glows rather than
--                    darkens, and a multiply cannot make a colour brighter
--   debris     0..1  leaves and litter carried on a gale
--   fog        0..1  scrolling noise-bank opacity
--   fogSpeed   0..2  how fast the banks drift
--   veil       0..1  flat achromatic haze (whiteout / murk)
--   dim        0..1  multiply-darken the frame
--   cool       0..1  push the multiply tint toward blue
--   warm       0..1  push it toward amber instead
--   glare      0..1  additive bloom -- sunlight on the lens
--   gust       0..1  strength of the slow wind oscillation
--   strike     n/min lightning strikes per minute, 0 = never
--
-- The four GRAIN channels (hail, sand, ash, debris) share one particle pool
-- and differ by colour, speed and bounce.  They stay separate channels
-- rather than one because they have to cross-fade independently during a
-- transition.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- SCHEDULING FIELDS (AUTO only; ignored when a type is pinned or forced)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--   weight       relative chance of being picked next
--   dayWeight    multiplier while the sun is up
--   nightWeight  multiplier while it is down
--   minMin/maxMin  spell length in minutes
--   follows      ids this type likes to arrive after, which doubles its
--                weight -- how a storm grows out of a downpour rather than
--                out of a clear sky
--   natural      false = never picked by AUTO.  The primal weathers and
--                Strong Winds are legendary-tier: they exist so a config
--                or a location override can force them, and so a battle
--                can be fought in one, but Kanto's sky does not produce
--                them on its own.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- BATTLE FIELDS
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--   battle   the id written into `battle.field.weather`.
--
--     THIS VOCABULARY IS NOT OURS.  Kanto-Reforged already implements
--     battle weather -- Weather Ball, Forecast/Castform, Sand Veil,
--     Chlorophyll and Swift Swim all read `battle.field.weather` and
--     expect the strings SUNNY / RAINY / SANDSTORM / HAIL / SNOWY.  So
--     those are the strings this mod writes, and the two systems drive
--     one field instead of fighting over two.  With that mod absent the
--     field is ours alone and the same strings still apply.
--
--     HARSH_SUN, HEAVY_RAIN, STRONG_WINDS and FOG extend the vocabulary.
--     Reforged passes a value it does not recognise straight through, so
--     extending is safe; lib/Battle.lua handles the extensions.
--
--   wet / frozen / sunny / sandy   capability tags.  The battle layer and
--     the region bias read these instead of ids, so A NEW TYPE IS
--     AUTOMATICALLY COVERED by both without being added to a second list.
