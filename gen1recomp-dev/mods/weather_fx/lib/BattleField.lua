-- ART BEHIND THE POKEMON.
--
-- =====================================================================
-- READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING HERE
-- =====================================================================
--
-- This is the ONLY part of weather_fx that patches engine internals.
-- Everything else is hooks and registries, which is why the rest of the
-- mod survives engine updates and never contends with another mod.  This
-- file gives that up deliberately, because there is no seam:
--
--   * `battle.overlay` runs at the END of the battle's draw -- anything
--     drawn there covers the Pokemon.
--   * `battleBg = "world"` exposes the letterbox voids only.  The
--     engine's own comment (BattleState:82): "The battle screen itself is
--     untouched: it keeps its white paper field in every mode."
--   * `render.compose` would work but demands taking over the ENTIRE
--     window composite -- SGB zones, palette pass, letterbox, GBC FX --
--     to place one image.
--
-- So the field fill is intercepted instead.  Both draw paths do the same
-- thing (BattleState:drawClassic and WideBattle.draw): set the paper
-- colour, then `g.rectangle("fill", 0, 0, W, H)` across the whole battle
-- surface.  For the duration of one battle draw, `love.graphics.rectangle`
-- is replaced with a function that spots THAT call -- the first full-
-- surface fill of the frame -- and draws the backdrop in its place.
-- Everything else passes straight through, and the original is restored
-- before the call returns, in every path including an error.
--
-- WHY INTERCEPTION RATHER THAN REIMPLEMENTING THE DRAW.  Copying
-- `drawClassic` into this mod would mean copying four hundred lines of
-- HUD, text, shake, slide and SGB handling, and re-copying them at every
-- engine update.  Intercepting one call depends on one line staying
-- shaped the way it is, and degrades to "no backdrop" when it changes
-- rather than to a broken battle.
--
-- =====================================================================
-- WHEN IT STANDS DOWN, AND WHY
-- =====================================================================
--
--   * SGB / colour mode.  That path draws into `bgCanvas` and then
--     recolours it by zone, as if it were Game Boy tiles.  A photographic
--     backdrop through a zone recolour looks like a fault, so this stays
--     out of its way unless the player insists.
--   * StadiumBattleFX, DRAMATIC_SHAPE, DRAMALESS_SHAPE.  They stage
--     battles their own way, and two mods patching the same draw means
--     the last one loaded wins.  Detected, not guessed.
--   * The nickname screen (`blankForAskName`), which clears the field on
--     purpose and would otherwise get scenery behind the naming box.
--
-- All three are overridable, because a player who can see their own
-- screen is better placed to judge than a guess in a config file.
