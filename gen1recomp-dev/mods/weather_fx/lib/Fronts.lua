-- WEATHER FRONTS.
--
-- Until now this mod had ONE weather.  It followed the player: walk out of
-- a blizzard and the blizzard came with you, because there was only ever a
-- single `State.id` and it described "the weather", not "the weather
-- somewhere".  That is fine for an effect and wrong for a world.
--
-- A front belongs to a PLACE.  Snow over Mahogany keeps snowing over
-- Mahogany after you leave, runs its own clock, and is still there when you
-- come back if it has not blown out.  The player is a visitor to whichever
-- front they are standing in.
--
-- =====================================================================
-- WHY REGIONS AND NOT MAPS
-- =====================================================================
--
-- Per-map weather sounds more accurate and is worse in play: crossing a map
-- boundary every twenty steps would mean the sky changing every twenty
-- steps, and a route split into three maps would have three weathers along
-- its length.  Weather systems are bigger than a screen.
--
-- So the world is divided into a few dozen REGIONS -- a town and the routes
-- around it -- and a front covers a whole region.  Walking from Route 30 to
-- Route 31 keeps the same sky because they are the same weather region; the
-- change happens at a boundary that feels like somewhere else.
--
-- Regions are matched by map-id PREFIX rather than an exhaustive list, so a
-- map mod that adds ROUTE_31_NORTH lands in the region its name implies
-- instead of falling through to nothing.
--
-- =====================================================================
-- WHAT MAKES IT A FRONT RATHER THAN A LOOKUP TABLE
-- =====================================================================
--
--   * Each region rolls its own weather on its own clock, using the same
--     weighting the global AUTO used -- so the geography that made snow
--     likelier on the mountain pass still does.
--   * Fronts DRIFT.  When a region's spell ends it does not roll blind:
--     it is twice as likely to inherit what a neighbouring region already
--     has.  That is what turns independent rolls into weather that moves
--     across the map, and it is the whole reason `neighbours` exists.
--   * Everything runs whether or not the player is there.  A region the
--     player has never visited still has a sky, because the Pokegear card
--     needs to show one and because a front that only exists while watched
--     is not a front.
--
-- Cost: one table of ~30 numbers ticked per frame, and a roll per region
-- every few minutes.  Nothing here scales with anything.

-- ------- the map

-- `at` is the region's position on the Pokegear's 20x14 panel grid, which
-- is what lets the card draw a weather map rather than a list.  Kanto and
-- Johto are both here: this mod runs on both games, and a region table that
-- only knew one would leave the other with no fronts at all.
--
-- The coordinates are approximate by design -- close enough to read as a
-- map, not a survey.
