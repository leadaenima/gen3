-- WHICH GENERATIONS A MOD IS ON FOR.
--
-- Asked for directly: "a per generation mod selection menu so you can have
-- mods on for gen1, gen2, or gen3 games selectively".  A mod that retextures
-- Hoenn has nothing to say about Red, and a Johto map pack loaded under
-- Emerald is at best dead weight -- but until this there was one switch for
-- the whole installation and no way to say so.
--
-- THE SHAPE ON DISK IS THE OLD ONE UNTIL IT HAS TO CHANGE, which is the point
-- of this module existing at all.  `options.mods[id]` has always been a plain
-- boolean, and it still is for every mod that is on (or off) everywhere:
--
--   true / false            -- exactly as before, all three generations
--   nil                     -- no entry; the caller's own default decides
--   { on = <bool>,          -- the master switch
--     gens = { b, b, b } }  -- ...and which generations it reaches
--
-- So a build that has never seen a per-generation mod writes and reads what it
-- always did, an older build handed one of these tables sees a truthy value
-- (the mod stays on, which is the safe way round), and nothing has to be
-- migrated in either direction.
--
-- THE MASTER IS NOT DERIVED FROM THE CHIPS.  `on = false` is off everywhere
-- whatever the chips say, and the chips are REMEMBERED while it is off -- a
-- player who turns a mod off and back on gets their selection back rather than
-- a reset to all three.  That is the whole reason this is a record and not
-- three loose booleans.

-- running outside its own claim half-applies and every symptom then reads as
-- an engine fault.  But the claim is a CLAIM: the author of a Gen 1/Gen 2 mod
-- who has just taught it Hoenn, or a player willing to find out what breaks,
-- must not be locked out by a line in a JSON file until a new release ships.
--
-- So the refusal is a default with a door in it.  The door is deliberately
-- separate from the chips: a chip is "I want this here", an override is "I
-- know the mod says otherwise", and collapsing the two would make every
-- ordinary chip press a decision about something the player never claimed.
