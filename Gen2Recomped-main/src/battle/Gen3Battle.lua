-- THE BATTLE SCREEN EMERALD DRAWS.
--
-- The simulation, the timing, the animations and every rule stay
-- BattleState's.  This module replaces the COMPOSITION only -- what size the
-- surface is, where the two sides stand, and what the boxes along the bottom
-- say -- exactly the way WideBattle does for the widescreen option.  Pictures,
-- font pages, border glyphs and HP tiles all still resolve through the engine,
-- so a display mode or an asset mod keeps owning the look.
--
-- WHAT WAS WRONG.  Hoenn was fighting on the Game Boy's screen: a 160x144
-- surface letterboxed inside a 240x160 window, with Gen 1's four-word menu on
-- it --
--
--     FIGHT   <PK><MN>              FIGHT     BAG
--     ITEM    RUN         against   POKeMON   RUN
--
-- -- which is not a wording difference.  Two of the four words are wrong, and
-- the two that survive have swapped diagonals: the cell that says PACK in
-- Emerald is the one that opened the party in this port, and the other way
-- round.  A player who has learned where BAG is presses it and gets the party.
--
-- THE MENU IS NOT WRITTEN HERE.  constants.gen3BattleMenu is one string off
-- the cartridge -- "FIGHT{CLEAR_TO 56}BAG\nPOKeMON{CLEAR_TO 56}RUN" -- so the
-- four words, the fact that there are two columns and the 56 pixels between
-- them are all the cartridge's own.  A dataset without the record falls back
-- to the Game Boy's words rather than refusing to draw a menu.
--
-- WHAT IS RECONSTRUCTED, and should be corrected against a recording rather
-- than argued about: where the two sides stand on the wider field, and where
-- the window edges fall.  Those are staging, and they are marked below.

-- into field.theme.textBox); the battle's was the one place still guessing.
--
-- The difference is visible: the reconstruction put the box eight pixels
-- lower and eight wider on each side, and its first line of text eight pixels

  -- THE LETTERS ON THIS BOX ARE BLITTED, NOT PAINTED.
  --
  -- Reported twice, and the second report is the answer to the first.  "The
  -- pokemon names and lvl text in battle is white but it shouldnt be" made
  -- this state an ink, which a style does by running the glyph through the
  -- tint shader.  Then: "their names are looking a little too bold not
  -- matching the rom" -- because that shader takes the glyph's ALPHA and
  -- paints every opaque pixel one colour, so a page whose glyph is a dark
  -- letter with a LIGHT drop shadow came back as letter and shadow in one
  -- ink.  That is a letter a pixel thicker down and right.
  --
  -- A Gen 3 font page is PRE-TINTED: it already carries the two tones the
  -- cartridge prints in, and Font blits it as it is whenever nothing is
  -- painting it.  The white was never the page -- it was a style left in
  -- force by another screen -- so what this box needs is not an ink of its
  -- own but the guarantee that no ink is set at all.
  -- ...AND NOTHING IS TO PAINT THEM.
  --
  -- Reported from play: "their names are looking a little too bold not
  -- matching the rom".  They were.  A style turns the tint shader on, and
  -- that shader takes the glyph's ALPHA and paints every opaque pixel one
  -- colour -- so a page whose glyph is a dark letter with a LIGHT drop
  -- shadow came out as letter and shadow in the same dark ink, which is a
  -- letter one pixel thicker down and right.  Bold, exactly as reported.
  --
  -- The page already carries the two tones the cartridge prints in.  Pushing

  -- came out through the panel's own bottom border and onto the EXP strip.
  --
  -- The arithmetic says why, and it says it for the player's panel only.  The
  -- small face's cell is ELEVEN rows -- the import measures it, it is not a
  -- constant here -- and the paper it is printed on is measured too: nineteen
  -- on the foe's box and TWENTY-SEVEN on the player's.  The foe's has two
  -- rows, a name and the bar: 11 + 8 is exactly its nineteen and it has never
  -- overflowed.  The player's has three, because it is the box that shows the
  -- numbers: 11 + 8 + 11 is THIRTY, and thirty does not go into twenty-seven.
  --
  -- The three that do not fit come out of the rows above, and they can: a
  -- glyph cell's last rows are descender space, and a Pokemon's name and a
  -- pair of numbers use none of it -- Hoenn prints both in capitals and
  -- digits.  So the bar and everything under it are lifted by exactly the

-- THE CARTRIDGE'S OWN BOTTOM PANEL
--
-- Reported from play: "the text in battle doesnt seem to be correct its really
-- dark but its not like that in the real rom, and the text box in battle has a
-- background in the real game but not in ours".
--
-- Both halves are the same missing thing.  Emerald's bottom strip is a
-- PICTURE -- one 240x48 panel with its own tiles, tilemap and palette -- and
-- the message on it is WHITE with a dark violet shadow on a teal ground, not
-- black on white.  This screen drew Game Boy boxes and printed pure black,
-- which is the one combination the cartridge never uses down there.
--
-- Three panels, chosen by what the player is being asked:
--
--     message   one full-width teal box
--     action    that box on the left, the menu frame on the right
--     moves     two framed boxes, names on the left and PP on the right
--
-- On the cartridge they are three bands of one 32x64 tilemap and it scrolls
-- between them; here they are three pictures and the screen picks one.
--
-- The MENU half of the strip is the player's OPTIONS frame, so its colours
-- come from a different palette than the message half -- which is why there
-- are two colour records and not one.

-- ...ONCE, THROUGH THE PAGE'S OWN TWO TONES.
--
-- Reported from play: "the textbox in battle doesnt seem to be using the
-- emerald font make it match the rom".  The glyphs WERE the cartridge's --
-- right face, right widths, right panel -- and they did not look like it,
-- because of what was done to them on the way to the screen.
--
-- This used to draw every line TWICE: once in the shadow colour at (1,1) and
-- again in the foreground at (0,0), each pass through the flat tint shader.
-- That shader takes a glyph's ALPHA and paints every opaque pixel one colour,
-- and an Emerald glyph is not one colour -- the page is PRE-TINTED and
-- already carries the letter and its drop shadow as two separate tones.  So
-- the first pass stamped the letter AND its baked shadow in the shadow ink,
-- the second stamped both again one pixel up and left in the foreground ink,
-- and what reached the screen was a four-way smear of a two-tone letter: too
-- thick, too dark, and the shadow in the wrong place on the far side.  That
-- is the same mistake the healthbox was reported for -- "their names are
-- looking a little too bold not matching the rom" -- and it was fixed there
-- and left standing here.
--
-- Font.beginTwoTone is what the fix put in: it recolours the page's two baked
-- tones SEPARATELY, so the letter keeps the shape the cartridge drew and only
-- the two inks change -- which is all the battle window's palette is.  One
-- pass, at (0,0), and the offsets stay in the signature because a cache
-- without the palette still has nothing to recolour with and falls back to
-- plain black-on-white.

-- WHERE THE TWO POKEMON STAND
--
-- The pics used to be placed by Gen 1's rule -- a 7x7 tile slot at a fixed
-- tile coordinate -- and then the whole slot was translated bodily into the
-- Gen 3 field with two reconstructed offsets.  On a 160x144 letterbox that
-- rule is the hardware's; on Emerald's 240x160 field it is nothing, and it
-- showed: the foe sat up in the corner well above its platform, and the
-- player's back pic was drawn at the Game Boy's 2x and ran off the bottom of
-- the screen through the message window.
--
-- SO THE PLATFORMS ARE MEASURED, out of the cartridge's own battle
-- background, and nothing here knows a coordinate.
--
-- A Gen 3 battle background is horizontal BANDS -- each row of the sky and
-- the ground is one colour all the way across -- with the two platforms
-- drawn over them.  A band reaches the edge of the screen and a platform
-- never does, so the colour of the longer of a row's two edge runs IS that
-- row's band, and everything else in the row is platform.  That is the whole
-- test: no palette, no address, and it re-measures itself for every one of
-- the cartridge's terrains.  The widest row of each blob is where its
-- surface faces the camera, which is where a Pokemon's feet go.
--
-- The measurement puts the foe's platform centred on x = 175.5 of 240, which
-- is a number this port did not choose.

  -- THE PICS ARE PLACED, NOT SHUNTED.
  --
  -- Each side used to keep the Game Boy's own 160x144 placement maths and
  -- then have the whole result translated bodily into the field by a pair of
  -- reconstructed offsets.  That is a fudge on top of a rule that does not
  -- apply: Gen 1 puts the foe in a 7x7 tile slot because its screen has no
  -- platforms to stand on, and Emerald's does.  So the offsets are gone and
  -- BattleState asks Gen3Battle.picPlacement instead, which measures the
  -- platforms out of the cartridge's own battle background.
  --
  -- ...AND THE REGION DOES NOT SURVIVE EITHER.
  --
  -- Reported from play, with a screenshot: "there seems to be a smaller box
  -- that's obscuring my pokemon", and then exactly what it was -- "its
  -- cutting him in half when i zoom in as if theres a smaller viewport just
  -- for the battle sprites".  That is precisely what this was: a scissor
  -- around the pics layer and nothing else, which is why only the two
  -- Pokemon were ever cut while the panels and the text were whole.
  --
  -- What it was for was "so nothing reaches the message window", and on THIS
  -- layout that job is already done twice over: drawTextArea runs after this,
  -- and Emerald's message strip is an opaque panel out of the cartridge (a
  -- cache without one falls back to Font.drawBox, which is opaque too).  A
  -- pic that reaches under it is covered, not shown.
  --
  -- And the scissor is in the DRAW TARGET's pixels, which are only the
  -- battle's own 240x160 while this engine owns the frame.  A mod that
  -- composes the battle into a surface of its own size -- a 3D field, which
  -- is what the report is from -- gets a 240x120 rectangle cut out of the
  -- top-left corner of something much bigger, and the sprite is sheared
  -- wherever that line falls.  The redundant clip was the whole bug.
  --
  -- `wideRegion` STAYS.  It is not about this scissor: it tells
  -- drawBattlerPic not to apply the GAME BOY's per-side tile windows (80x96
  -- and 88..160) during a displacement effect, and those windows describe a
  -- 160x144 screen that this layout is not.

  -- THROUGH THE BATTLE'S OWN METHODS, not the locals above.
  --
  -- Every layer of the classic screen is a BattleState method, and that is
  -- not decoration: it is the entire seam a mod has for suppressing or
  -- replacing one.  DRAMATIC_SHAPE wraps drawPicsLayer, drawHUDs,
  -- drawTextArea and drawAnimLayer by name.  This screen called three of the
  -- four as file-local functions, so on a Gen 3 battle those three wrappers
  -- never fired -- the mod's own HUD panels drew, and then the flat ones drew
  -- over them.  The methods dispatch back here (BattleState:drawHUDs and
  -- friends), so the implementation is still this file's; what changed is
  -- that there is now a door in front of it.
