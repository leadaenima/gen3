-- THE SECOND PAIR, AND WHY IT IS NOT WRITTEN INSIDE THE CONSTRUCTOR
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Reported from play: "Double battles still aren't working properly, the
-- second person doesn't throw out their pokemon and i don't throw out my
-- second pokemon."  Two Pokemon on the field, two healthboxes, and a
-- `double` flag that said there should be four.
--
-- THE ORDER WAS THE BUG.  Commands.start_battle builds the battle first and
-- decides afterwards whether it is a double:
--
--     battle = BattleState.newTrainer(game, class, 1)
--     if opts and opts.double then battle.double = true end
--     if battle.trainer and battle.trainer.doubleBattle then ... end
--
-- and it HAS to be that way round for the second of those two, because
-- `battle.trainer` is what the constructor produces.  But the code that
-- actually sends the second pair out lived inside the constructor, behind
-- `if self.double`, which at that moment was still nil.  So the flag was set
-- on a battle whose right-hand slots had already been skipped: `isDouble`
-- answered true, the turn loop sorted four entries, the layout drew four --
-- and two of the four were never put on the field.
--
-- So it moves out here, where either caller can reach it, and it is
-- IDEMPOTENT -- a slot that is already filled is left alone.  That matters
-- for the two-trainer battle, where `addOpponentTrainer` has already put the
-- SECOND trainer's lead in the right-hand opponent slot and this must not
-- overwrite it with the first trainer's second Pokemon.
--
-- Both sides lead with two and they are the next healthy one on each side --
-- the same rule the left flank used, applied once more.  Nothing here is
-- reached in a single battle, and a single battle is what every Gen 1 and
-- Gen 2 fight is: those cartridges have no doubles at all.

--     the partner is position ~ 2; the foes are the other side's two
--
-- which is why `self.player` and `self.enemy` can stay exactly what they
-- always were: they ARE positions 0 and 1, the left-hand pair, and a single
-- battle is a double with the right-hand pair empty.  Nothing that reads
-- them has to learn about positions to keep being correct; only the code
-- that must consider BOTH flanks does.

-- loop that takes one action and a screen that draws one Pokemon is worse
-- than the single battle it replaces, not better.
