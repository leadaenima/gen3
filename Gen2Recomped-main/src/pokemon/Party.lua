-- the species icon and name in the party list, the stats screen, the battle

-- dropped by an older save or an importer) leaked the whole lot at once, and
-- a leak here is a spoiler the player can never un-see.  eggSteps is only
-- ever set alongside isEgg and cleared by HatchEggs, so it is a safe second
-- witness.
