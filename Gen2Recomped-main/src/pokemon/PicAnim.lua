-- Crystal's front-pic frame animations.
--
-- Only Crystal has them.  Its front pics carry extra tiles past the body
-- (CYNDAQUIL decompresses to 49 tiles for a 5x5 pic), and four ROM tables
-- describe how to swap those tiles in over time.  The import side does all
-- the decoding -- see RomExtractorGen2:gen2PicAnimation -- and leaves one
-- record per species:
--
--   def.picAnim = {
--     sheet  = "assets/generated/battle/anim/<mon>.png",  -- frames 1..N
--     count  = N, width =, height =,
--     play   = { { frame =, dur = }, ... },   -- <Mon>Animation, flattened
--     idle   = { ... },                       -- <Mon>AnimationIdle
--   }
--
-- Frame 0 is the untouched front pic, so it is NOT in the sheet: callers
-- fall back to the still they already have.  Durations are plain 60Hz
-- frames -- PokeAnim_GetDuration folds in a speed scaler, but every entry in
-- the PokeAnims table (34:$4042) passes 0 for it.
--
-- Playback here is `play` once, then `idle` once, then a hold on frame 0 --
-- the still.  That is a real PokeAnims sequence (34:$405C is cry / setup /
-- play / setwait / wait / idle / play / finish); none of the nine loops
-- forever, and looping the idle script would leave CYNDAQUIL flaring its
-- back every second for the whole battle.  The animation therefore plays
-- when the mon appears and when the summary page opens, exactly like the
-- cartridge, and then the pic settles.
