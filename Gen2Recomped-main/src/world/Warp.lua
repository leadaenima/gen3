-- Warp resolution.  A warp fires when:
--   * the player finishes a step onto a warp cell whose collision tile is a
--     door tile or warp tile (stairs, doors, mats, cave entrances), or
--   * the player stands on a warp cell and tries to walk off the map edge
--     (exit carpets at the bottom of interiors), or
--   * the player stands on a warp cell and the "extra" check passes -- on
--     arrival with the d-pad held, or on a blocked step (route-gate
--     doorways, the Vermilion dock entrance, ...).
-- This mirrors pokered's CheckWarpsNoCollision / CheckWarpsCollision /
-- ExtraWarpCheck (home/overworld.asm).

local Runtime = require("src.mods.Runtime")

local Warp = {}

-- Returns the warp entry to take when arriving at (cx,cy), or nil.
--
-- This is CheckWarpTile (home/map.asm) whole, and the second half is the part
-- that used to be missing here:
--
--     CheckWarpTile::
--         call GetDestinationWarpNumber   ; is there a warp on this cell?
--         ret nc
--         push bc
--         farcall CheckDirectionalWarp    ; ...and may it fire from a STEP?
--         pop bc
--         ret nc
--         call CopyWarpData
--         scf
--         ret
--
-- CheckDirectionalWarp (engine/overworld/tile_events.asm) is four comparisons
-- and a cleared carry:
--
--     ; If directional warp, clear carry (requires button press to activate).
--     ; Otherwise, set carry (warps immediately).
--         cp COLL_WARP_CARPET_DOWN / cp COLL_WARP_CARPET_LEFT
--         cp COLL_WARP_CARPET_UP   / cp COLL_WARP_CARPET_RIGHT
--
-- So a DOOR, staircase, cave or warp panel takes you the instant you step on
-- it, and a CARPET never does: it waits until you walk on in the carpet's own
-- direction, already facing that way (DoPlayerMovement .CheckWarp, which the
-- overworld's checkGen2CarpetExit implements).
--
-- Without it, a mat is a trapdoor. Every doormat in the game is at least two
-- cells wide, and the arrival cell is only inert until you leave it -- so
-- taking one step ALONG the mat, from one carpet cell to its neighbour,
-- landed on a live warp and fired it. That is the reported "walk down and it
-- warps you without you ever walking into the building", and it is every
-- Center, Mart, gym and house in both regions.
--
-- The test belongs HERE, next to the warp lookup it qualifies, rather than at
-- the call sites: the step handler was already filtering carpets out of the
-- copy it uses to outrank coord events, and the copy it actually warps on --
-- a second Warp.onArrive a hundred lines further down -- was not.
