-- HOENN'S WEATHER, ON THE FIELD.
--
-- Every Gen 3 map header carries a weather byte; 90 maps in Hoenn set one and
-- the region's scripts set several more.  The byte has been read since the map
-- headers went in, and named since the weather stage went in -- and until now
-- the only thing that ever asked for it was the BATTLE, which cares about
-- four of the sixteen.  Standing on Route 113 in the ash, or on the seafloor,
-- or in the fog on Route 120, looked exactly like standing in Littleroot.
--
-- WHAT IS THE CARTRIDGE'S AND WHAT IS NOT, stated plainly because the
-- difference matters when someone comes back to this:
--
--   THE CARTRIDGE'S -- which weathers exist, what they are called, which map
--   gets which, and which of them a battle inherits.  All of that is read out
--   of the dump (constants.gen3WeatherNames, the map header's byte,
--   constants.gen3BattleWeather) and none of it is stated here.
--
--   NOT THE CARTRIDGE'S -- what a raindrop LOOKS like.  Emerald draws its
--   weather with sprite sheets and a palette blend, and neither is extracted
--   yet, so the particles below are this port's own reconstruction: the
--   direction, density and speed of each are chosen to read as the thing the
--   cartridge names, and they are not measurements.  When the sheets are
--   extracted this module is where they land, and the shape of it -- a veil
--   colour plus a list of particles -- is the shape that art fits into.
--
-- Deterministic on purpose.  The particle field is seeded from the weather's
-- own name and advanced by a frame count, so the same weather at the same
-- frame draws the same thing every time -- which is what lets the suite
-- assert that ash falls and sand blows sideways rather than asserting that
-- something was drawn.

-- rather than sitting in the run of sixteen.  Both are the same shape: mostly

-- The dataset's own tables, when the import read them.  The two above are the

-- ...AND IN A BATTLE.
--
-- Reported from play: "in battle when there are weather effects theyre not
-- showing properly".  They were not showing at all.  The battle has modelled
-- weather since the ruleset went in -- it drives the damage, the accuracy,
-- CLOUD NINE and AIR LOCK -- and nothing ever drew it, so a Rain Dance was
-- four turns of text and no rain.
--
-- WHICH LOOK BELONGS TO WHICH BATTLE WEATHER IS THE CARTRIDGE'S OWN ANSWER,
-- read backwards.  constants.gen3BattleWeather is the map-weather -> battle-
-- weather table the import lifts out of the dump: RAIN, RAIN_THUNDERSTORM and
-- DOWNPOUR all become WEATHER_RAIN in a battle, SNOW becomes HAIL, DROUGHT
-- becomes SUN.  Inverting it gives the field weather a battle weather looks
-- like without a single name being chosen here -- and where several field
-- weathers map onto one battle weather (rain has three), the one whose name
-- IS the battle weather wins, and failing that the first in sorted order, so
-- the answer does not depend on table iteration.
--
-- A dataset with no such table falls back to the four names that are spelled
-- the same on both sides, which is three of the four.

-- AN EVEN SCATTER, WHICH IS NOT THE SAME AS A RANDOM ONE.
--
-- The first version of this multiplied a counter and read consecutive outputs
-- for a particle's x and its y.  Consecutive outputs of a weak generator are
-- CORRELATED, so every flake of snow, every speck of ash and every grain of
-- sand landed on the same diagonal, and Hoenn's weather came out looking like
-- tinsel.  Strengthening the generator did not fix it: the runtime is LuaJIT,
-- where every number is a double, so a hash built on 32-bit multiplies loses
-- exactly the low bits it lives on.
--
-- So not a hash at all.  The R2 low-discrepancy sequence walks the unit
-- square in two irrational strides taken from the plastic number -- the two
-- dimensional analogue of the golden ratio -- and spreads points EVENLY by
-- construction rather than by luck.  Measured over a 6x4 grid of the screen
-- it fills all twenty-four cells with between one and five particles each and
-- leaves x and y correlated below 0.12, which the suite asserts.
--
-- Even spread is the actual requirement -- rain should not clump -- so this
-- is the right instrument rather than a cheaper stand-in for randomness.
