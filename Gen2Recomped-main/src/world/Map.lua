-- CheckWarpCollision (05:$4A18): $60, $68 and the whole $70-$7F carpet/door
-- range are the collision classes that let a Gen2 warp_event fire.
-- DOES THIS MAP'S TILESET SPEAK IN GEN 2 COLLISION CLASSES?
--
-- `cellTile` has two answers and they share no vocabulary. With a collision
-- table it returns the cell's CLASS byte -- $71 an outdoor door, $7B a cave
-- mouth -- and the entrance range just below is meaningful. Without one it
-- returns the cell's south-west TILE ID, which is Gen 1's way of saying the
-- same thing in a completely different alphabet.
--
-- An ADOPTED tileset is that second case, and it is not hypothetical: the map
-- editor brings a Gen 1 set across whole -- blocks, walkable list, doorTiles,
-- warpTiles -- and there is no collision table to bring, because Gen 1 has
-- none. `CAVERN@red` arrives with `warpTiles = { 24, 26, 34 }`, the cave
-- ladders, and not one of those tile ids lands in $60/$68/$70-$7F.
--
-- So `warpAtCell` tested tile ids against a class range, they failed, and it
-- returned nil for every warp on every imported map. That is the whole of
-- "the editor says they're linked and in game they do nothing": the link was
-- always fine, the gate in front of it was answering a question the data
-- could not be asked. The gate is real -- it is how the Ruins of Alph
-- chambers and the Ice Path holes stay shut -- so it stays, and it now only
-- applies where the map can actually answer it.
-- IS THIS TILESET'S `collision` A TABLE OF GEN 2 COLLISION CLASSES?
--
-- Not merely "does it have one".  A Gen 3 tileset pair also carries a
-- `collision` array, and it holds something else entirely: one metatile
-- BEHAVIOUR byte per metatile -- what kind of ground this is -- while a Gen 2
-- table holds passability classes.  The two number spaces overlap and mean
-- different things, so reading one as the other invents rules out of thin
-- air.  It did: $B2, $B3, $B5, $C0 and $C3 are ordinary walkable ground in
-- Hoenn and one-way WALLS in Johto, so 85 cells in the region fenced the
-- player off a side for no reason at all, with nothing on screen to show it.
