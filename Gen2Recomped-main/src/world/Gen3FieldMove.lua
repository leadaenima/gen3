-- USING AN HM, THE WAY HOENN SHOWS IT.
--
-- Asked for directly: "we also need the transition for using HMs like the rom
-- that slides across the screen shows our pokemon and then performs the HM
-- move and our player usually holds up a ball during this too".
--
-- On the cartridge every field move goes through the same presentation before
-- anything happens to the world: a banded window sweeps across the screen
-- carrying the Pokemon's picture, and while it is up the player wears the
-- FIELD MOVE pose -- standing still with a Poke Ball held out.  The port ran
-- the effect and skipped the presentation entirely, so SURF, DIVE and the
-- rest happened with no announcement at all.
--
-- WHAT IS DERIVED AND WHAT IS NOT, said plainly.
--
-- DERIVED: the player's pose.  It is sPlayerAvatarGfxIds' sixth pair -- the
-- same table the diving suit came out of, checked the same way -- and it is a
-- real sheet of the cartridge's, not a frame picked by eye
-- (RomExtractorGen3:playerAvatarStates, constants.gen3PlayerSprites).  The
-- Pokemon's picture is its own front sprite, which the import already rips.
--
-- RECONSTRUCTED: the BAND.  Emerald's is gFieldMoveStreaksTiles, a tilemap
-- scrolled behind the picture, and the import does not rip it; nothing here
-- pretends otherwise.  What is drawn instead is the same figure -- a lit band
-- the height of the cartridge's, streaked with moving lines, sweeping in from
-- one side and out the other -- in the cartridge's own window colours where
-- the cache carries them.  The timings below are measured off the scene.

-- RECONSTRUCTED: the beats of the sweep, in frames.
--
-- RAISE comes first and draws NOTHING, which is the point of it.
--
-- Reported from play: "i didnt see my player hold up a ball like he does in
-- the real game".  The pose was on -- it is on for the whole of this state --
-- and it was under the band: the window is fifty-six pixels tall across the
-- middle of a hundred-and-sixty-pixel screen, and the player stands in the
-- middle of the screen.  So for every frame the pose existed, the thing
-- announcing it was drawn on top of it.
--
-- The cartridge does not have that problem because it does not do the two at
-- once: the character raises the ball, and THEN the window sweeps in.  This
-- beat is that pause -- the pose is worn and nothing else is drawn -- and the
-- sweep follows it.
-- ...and how long each frame of the pose itself is held.  The sheet's frames
-- are the reach and the raise; RAISE_FRAMES is long enough for all of them at
-- this step, so the ball is up well before the band arrives.
