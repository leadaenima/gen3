-- widened to everything the current view size can show so a full
-- zoom-out never runs past the rendered set.  Re-run whenever the view
-- grows (zoom/resize), not only on setMap.
--
-- Neighbors are built eagerly here.  A TileRenderer is now a light object --
-- the tile layer draws windowed to the camera, so nothing per-map is
-- constructed up front (see TileRenderer) -- so there is no build cost to
-- amortize and no prefetch race to lose at a seam.  That is what the old
-- one-per-frame streaming queue existed to hide, and it is gone.
-- How far out from the player the neighbour set has to reach, in world
-- pixels, as a HALF-EXTENT either side.
--
-- The flat view answers this for itself: half the visible world plus a tile
-- row of slack is exactly what a 160x144 screen can show past its own edge.
-- A 3D renderer cannot use that answer. A diorama camera pulled back over a
-- route sees several screens in every direction, and what is not in
-- `self.neighbors` is not merely undrawn -- it was never loaded, so the
-- renderer has no map there to mesh and falls back to its own border-block
-- apron. That is the wall of border tiles fencing in a route, and the
-- neighbour that only appears once you have crossed the seam: the set is
-- rebuilt around the new map on arrival, which is the first moment it
-- contains anything you were already looking at.
--
-- So a renderer that sees further says so, by setting `neighborReachW` /
-- `neighborReachH` on the world -- the same shape as `viewW`/`viewH`, and
-- for the same reason: the engine cannot infer another renderer's frustum,
-- and guessing a generous default would load half of Johto for the flat game
-- that never asked. Unset is today's behaviour exactly.
--
-- Widening this is not free -- every neighbour is a loaded Map and a spawned
-- ghost cast -- which is why it is a request from the thing doing the drawing
-- rather than a constant here.

-- the runner parks and never wakes: the map draws, the music plays, and no

-- gates every input frame in this file, so a coroutine yielded with nothing
-- left to wake it is a total loss with no message.
--
-- The cartridge cannot reach this state -- its script context is torn down by
-- the map change -- so a port that can must at least be able to SAY so.  What
-- counts as progress is everything that legitimately parks a script:
--
--   * a frame wait counting down, or a per-frame poll being asked
--   * a scripted walk in flight, or the player mid-step
--   * a movement wait that is still watching for its walker
--   * anything on top of the field -- a text box, a battle, a menu, a
--     transition -- because the field does not update underneath those, so
--     this function is not even called
--
-- With none of those true for SIX SECONDS the script is not waiting for
-- anything: it is stranded.  That is said out loud, once, with the map on it;
-- and after a further six the runner is put down so the player has their game
-- back.  Recovering is not a fix and is not meant to look like one -- the log
-- line is the fix's starting point -- but a stranded cutscene should cost a
-- scene, not a save.

  -- frame behind the arrival step -- and on Route 101 the arrival step IS
  -- the trigger, so Birch never got chased.
  --

  -- script has not run yet -- and this hook was gated on nothing but the

  -- exactly one reason: so that row cannot match on arrival.  Asked during the
  -- fade it matched every time, and walking through the gym door dropped the
  -- player straight through the floor without touching the ice.

-- sweeps back to is the one ordinary grass metatile in the same bank of the
-- same tileset (RomExtractorGen3:ashGrass).

-- Route 111's desert approach, Route 115's north shelf and Route 119.

-- PRESSING B STANDS THE BIKE UP.  A tap of B while stationary puts the rider
-- into a WHEELIE -- front wheel off the ground, going nowhere.  Keep B down
-- and a counter runs; only once it passes its threshold does the wheelie
-- become the BUNNY HOP, and only then is the rider hopping.  Letting B go
-- drops back to normal -- unless the cell underneath is a bumpy slope, where
-- the cartridge holds the wheelie rather than dumping the rider off it.
--
-- Holding B while MOVING is the moving wheelie, which is a different thing
-- again: it rides rails but does not hop.
--
-- The threshold is not written here.  extractBike derives it out of the

-- with the two bikes' speeds, and the engine degrades to plain riding if the

-- SURF, you should notice dark patches of water.  Use DIVE if you come to
-- deep water like it.  You'll drop to the seafloor.  When you want to come
-- back up, use DIVE again.  In some places, it won't be possible for you to
-- surface, though."
--
-- Three of those clauses are data, and all three come out of the import:
--
--   * the dark patches are one metatile behaviour (constants.gen3Dive.behaviour);
--   * the seafloor under a route is a whole separate map, named by the route
--     header's own connection list -- direction 5 down, 6 back up -- and the
--     same size to the cell, which is why the warp keeps (x, y) exactly;
--   * the places you cannot surface are two more behaviours, on the seafloor
--     side (constants.gen3Dive.noSurfacing).
--
-- Underwater the player is NOT surfing: the seafloor is elevation 3, the
-- same as dry land, and setMap takes the arrival cell's elevation -- so the
-- walk down there needs nothing special from Collision at all.

-- colour like it's supposed to".  Both were this.
--
-- A Gen 3 renderer bakes the visible window into a sprite batch and only
-- rebuilds it when something says so -- which is why the cartridge's own
-- scripts change a metatile with `setmetatile` and then call
-- DrawWholeMapView.  Every terrain effect in Hoenn wrote its new block
-- straight into the map and never asked for the redraw: the ice cracked, the
-- ash swept, the log sank and the plank sagged, all of it recorded and none
-- of it drawn until something else happened to rebuild the window (usually
-- leaving the room).  A puzzle you cannot see the state of is a puzzle you
-- cannot solve.

-- the player has already walked off.

-- HOENN'S TALL GRASS IS A SPRITE, NOT A LAYER.
--

-- Game Boy map the trick is a BG overdraw -- drawCellBottom redraws the
-- cell's lower tile row over the character's feet -- and on Gen 3 that call
-- is a silent no-op, because a Gen 3 renderer has no 8x8 tile atlas to draw
-- it out of.  Every Gen 3 metatile's SECOND layer is already drawn above the
-- sprites, which is what puts a character behind a treetop, so the obvious
-- guess is that the grass belongs there -- and it does not: metatile 13, the
-- ordinary tall grass every route in Hoenn is made of, is 256 opaque pixels
-- on the bottom layer and ZERO on the top.  There is nothing there to hide
-- behind.
--
-- Emerald draws the blades as a FIELD EFFECT: a sixteen-square sprite spawned
-- on the cell, drawn over whoever is standing in it, and taken away when they
-- leave.  The art and its palette are read off the cartridge's field-effect

-- simulated-joypad / NPC scripted movement, with no idle frame between
-- tiles.  Phase 1 retires finished moves (which may chain new ones);
-- phase 2 then starts every not-yet-moving move.
-- A MOVE WHOSE WALKER IS GONE MUST STILL END.
--
-- `#self.scriptMoves > 0` is one of the conditions that says "a script owns
-- the map": it gates every input frame AND drainPendingScripts.  So a single
-- queued move that can never retire does not slow anything down -- it locks
-- the player where they stand, with no text box, no cutscene and nothing on
-- screen to say why.  That is the worst failure shape this file has.
--
-- Two ways a move gets stranded, and the loop below could retire neither:
--
--   * the entity is nil.  The retirement test reads `not (mv.entity and
--     mv.entity.moving)`, which is TRUE for a nil entity -- but it is paired
--     with `mv.remaining <= 0`, and a fresh move has steps left.  The starting
--     loop then skips it too (both its arms begin `if e and ...`).  Never
--     retired, never stepped.
--
--   * the entity was DESPAWNED mid-step.  syncEventFlagObjects removes an
--     object from `npcs` and `entities` the moment a script hides it, and a
--     cutscene routinely hides someone who is walking.  Nothing then updates
--     that sprite, so `moving` stays true for ever and the first test never
--     passes.
--
-- The cartridge has no equivalent: a despawned object's movement simply stops
-- being anyone's business.  So an orphaned move is retired HERE and its
-- onDone still fires -- which is what lets the chain behind it finish, the
-- `waitmovement` that was waiting on it resume, and the queue drain.

-- samples the tileset SHEET per face, with its own UVs. So a mod that replaces
-- the world pass needs the same sheet the flat renderer builds its quads from,
-- and the tileset record that says how it is laid out.
--
-- The name is the one Gen1Recomp published and mods were written against
-- (`World:atlasFor`). Without it STADIUM2_OVERWORLD_MODELS fails at
-- `attachRenderer` with "Gold World:atlasFor is unavailable", its renderFrame
-- returns no canvas, and the engine quietly falls back to the flat draw --
-- which reads, from the player's side, as "the 3D world just does not turn on"
-- with an empty log and every option switched on. Providing it is cheap and it
-- is the seam the contract already assumed.
--
-- Returns the RAW sheet, deliberately, plus the tileset record:
--   * a caller doing its own colour work (Gen 2 art is four-shade source, and
--     the palette is chosen per 8x8 tile at bake time) needs the unbaked
--     pixels, and re-baking an already-baked atlas would double-apply it;
--   * `map.renderer.image` -- the baked one -- stays available to anything
--     that wants what the 2D path actually painted.
--
-- `mapDef` is a map DEFINITION (`Game.data.maps.CERULEAN_CITY`), matched
-- against the current map and its loaded neighbours first so the live tileset
-- record (with any runtime normalisation on it) wins; a def for a map that is
-- not resident falls back to the static tileset table.

--
--   * a BEHAVIOUR byte per metatile.  Gen 2 stores a collision class and the
--     art has to be read to find out what a cell IS; Gen 3 says outright that
--     this cell is tall grass, deep water, a jumpable ledge facing south, a
--     door, a counter, a bookshelf, ice, a log raft.
--   * a LAYER TYPE per metatile, which is the cartridge's own answer to "does
--     the player pass in front of this or behind it".  A voxel renderer spends
--     most of its guessing budget on exactly that question.
--   * an ELEVATION per CELL.  Gen 2 records no height at all -- a terrace and
--     the grass below it are both collision $00, which is why the Johto
--     profile has to infer terraces from floor art.  Gen 3 gives the Y axis
--     directly, and it is what makes Route 110's cycling road stand over the
--     sea rather than lie in it.
--
-- Returns nil on Gen 1 and Gen 2, which is how a caller tests for the arm.
-- Never raises: this runs inside a mod's render callback.

-- WHAT IS GROWING IN THE PLOT, DRAWN.
--
-- Reported from play: "berry trees are invisible same with sprouts etc".
-- Three things were missing at once and the cartridge does all three in one
-- function, SetBerryTreeGraphics:
--
--   * THE FRAME IS THE STAGE.  StartSpriteAnim(sprite, berryStage) -- the
--     tree's animation table IS its five growth stages, and the import reads
--     which frames each one cycles (gen3Berries.trees.stages) rather than
--     counting them out.  Without it every tree showed frame zero, which is
--     the seed: a fruiting tree drew a bare patch of soil.
--   * THE SHEET IS THE BERRY.  `sprite->images` is swapped to the berry's own
--     pic table, so a PECHA tree and an ORAN tree are different art from the
--     flowering stage on.
--   * AND AN EMPTY PLOT IS INVISIBLE, which this port already did (see
--     plotEmpty in the draw pass) and is the only one of the three that was
--     right.
--
-- Asked every frame rather than at spawn, for the same reason plotEmpty is:
-- a tree is planted, grows, is watered and is picked without the map ever
-- reloading.  It costs a table lookup per tree, and a map has at most three.
-- WHICH GROUND SHOWS YOU BACK.
--
-- Reported from play: "puddles and the bright blue water arent showing their
-- reflections like they do in the emerald rom".  The set is not named here --
-- it is derived at import from MetatileBehavior_IsReflective (see
-- extractReflections) and comes out as POND_WATER, PUDDLE and Sootopolis'
-- lake.  Notably NOT ocean or deep water: those are surfable, and what
-- reflects there is the surfer, standing on the blob, on one of these.
--
-- A cache that predates the stage answers nothing and nothing reflects, which
-- is exactly what this port did before and is a missing picture rather than a
-- wrong one.
function OverworldState:reflectiveCell(cx, cy)
  local set = Game and Game.data and Game.data.constants
              and Game.data.constants.gen3Reflection
  local list = set and set.behaviours

-- ...AND THE WATER IS RARELY THE TILE YOU ARE STANDING ON.
--
-- Reported from play, after the first cut of this shipped: "its working only
-- when surfing, its supposed to work for puddles and when standing on ground
-- near water as well".  That is right, and the first cut asked the wrong
-- question -- it asked what is under the FEET, which is only ever true while
-- you are surfing or standing in a puddle.
--
-- What a top-down reflection actually needs is the water the character is
-- standing ABOVE: the cells BELOW them, which is where their image would
-- fall.  So the search starts one row down and runs as many rows as the
-- sprite is tall in cells, spreading out to its width -- the first reflective
-- cell wins, and the object's own cell is asked first so a puddle underfoot
-- still reflects.
--
-- WHAT IS DERIVED HERE AND WHAT IS NOT, said plainly because the two are
-- different: the SET of reflective behaviours is read off the cartridge
-- (extractReflections finds MetatileBehavior_IsReflective by shape and picks
-- it out of two candidates by which one a ground effect calls).  The SHAPE of
-- this search -- one row down, the sprite's own size -- is not: the
-- cartridge's ground-effect flag reads a single behaviour byte off the object
-- struct, and the wider scan that Emerald plainly does could not be located
-- in the code.  It is sized off the sprite rather than a number chosen here,
-- and it is short on purpose: a character in the middle of a field does not
-- reflect, one at the water's edge does.
--
-- ...AND IT RETURNS THE CELLS, NOT A YES.
--
-- The first cut answered "does this character reflect" with a boolean, and
-- that turned out to be half an answer: reported twice from play, "the npc
-- relections need to be masked by the ground and bridges, walkable areas
-- etc".  A reflection is visible exactly where there is water to hold it and
-- NOWHERE ELSE -- so the same cells that decide whether it reflects at all
-- are the clip region it has to be drawn through, and finding them twice
-- (once to decide, once to mask) is how the two drift apart.
--
-- The list is the cells the reflection can actually be PAINTED in, which is
-- the column the sprite stands in and the rows its mirrored image falls
-- across -- its own cell (a puddle underfoot) down through as many rows as
-- it is tall.  Water to one SIDE is not in that list on purpose: the image
-- falls straight down in this projection, so a character beside a pond
-- reflects into whatever is directly below them, not into the pond.
--
-- ...AND THE SHAPE IS THE CARTRIDGE'S, not a guess any more.
--
-- ObjectEventCheckForReflectiveSurface (ROM:0096A8C) is exactly this loop,
-- and it settles three things the first two cuts got wrong:
--
--   * it NEVER asks about the object's own cell.  It starts one row DOWN
--     (`mov r0,#1 / mov r10,r0`, then `y + r10 + i`) and runs `height` rows
--     from there, so a character reflects into the water they are standing
--     ABOVE and a puddle underfoot does not reflect them at all.
--   * the extent is the sprite's own size in cells, `(w + 8) / 16` and
--     `(h + 8) / 16` -- so an ordinary 16x32 character is ONE column and TWO
--     rows, and the sideways sweep the previous cut did is not in the
--     cartridge for that size at all.
--   * it asks the same of previousCoords (`ldsh [r5,#0x14]`/`[r5,#0x16]`)
--     as of currentCoords, which is what keeps a reflection alive across the
--     sixteen frames of a step instead of blinking at every cell boundary.
--     Here the pair is (cellX, targetX): mid-step this port leaves cellX on
--     the cell being left and targetX on the one being entered.
--
-- The returned cells are also the clip region (see the draw pass), so a
-- character beside water rather than above it reflects into nothing, which
-- is the same picture the cartridge draws for the same reason.

-- ---- RINGS WHERE A FOOT MEETS WATER ---------------------------------------
--
-- Reported from play: "no puddle ripples when walking in it".  The cartridge
-- spawns a field effect every time a step FINISHES on one of three
-- behaviours, and the set is read off MetatileBehavior_HasRipples at import
-- rather than named here (see RomExtractorGen3.RIPPLE) -- it comes out as
-- pond water, a puddle and the shallow water you can walk through.
--
-- The ring is an object at priority 3 with subpriority 151, against a
-- reflection's 152: both sit under everything of the map except its bottom
-- layer, and the rings sit over the reflection.  So this draws in the same
-- pass, after the reflections, and is covered by the same layers.
--
-- WHY "when the step finishes" is a cell change and not a movement callback:
-- the cartridge asks its ground-effect question once a step has completed and
-- the object's currentCoords have moved on.  Watching the cell an entity is
-- ON is the same event, arrives for the player and every NPC alike, and needs
-- no hook in either mover.

-- DOES THIS WATER HOLD THE IMAGE STILL, OR SWAY IT?

    -- point projects under the pipeline's own camera.  That is the direct

    -- `scale` is Zoom.scale over Renderer:fitScale, which measures the
    -- drawable, and Renderer:endFrame composites the returned canvas so that
    -- one canvas pixel is one display pixel.  This line used to read
    -- love.graphics.getDimensions() -- LOVE UNITS -- while calling the result

    -- scale TWICE: the canvas came out that much smaller and was then drawn

    -- CORNER at 1/dpi of the screen with black around it.  Invisible on
    -- desktop, where units and pixels are the same thing.  On Android the DPI
    -- scale is the display density, so the world came out roughly a third of
    -- the size in each direction.
    --
    -- DRAMATIC_SHAPE worked around this by asking the GPU itself (its
    -- `sceneSize` helper) rather than trusting the ctx, which is why that mod
    -- looked right on a phone while forks of it made before that fix did not.

    -- WHO THE TOP LAYER COVERS, which is not everybody.
    --
    -- Reported from play: "when walking on bridges it makes my character go
    -- under them rather than walking on top of them".  On the cartridge the
    -- covering layer is a background at priority 1 and the sprite's own
    -- priority comes from its elevation, so an object on ordinary ground
    -- (priority 2) is hidden by it and one on a bridge deck (priority 1) is
    -- not -- see extractSpritePriority.  Here that is the same thing as
    -- drawing the deck's walkers AFTER the layer instead of before it.
    -- ---- REFLECTIONS FIRST, AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TOP LAYER ------
    --
    -- Reported from play: "the twins are reflected onto the deck instead of
    -- below it" and "they need to be obfuscated by the ground".  Both are the
    -- same thing.  A character standing on a bridge is deliberately drawn
    -- AFTER the top layer (see `onTop` below) so the deck does not bury them
    -- -- and their reflection has to be on the OPPOSITE side of that layer,
    -- because what the deck hides is exactly what makes it read as a
    -- reflection in the water under the bridge rather than a second person
    -- standing on the planks.
    --
    -- So it is its own pass, before every sprite and before drawAbove, for
    -- every entity including the ones that will be drawn on top.  Whether a
    -- given entity reflects at all is still decided here, at draw time, since
    -- a character walks between water's edge and dry ground without the map
    -- reloading.
    --
    -- ...AND CLIPPED TO THE WATER ITSELF.  Reported twice: "they need to be
    -- masked by the ground and bridges, walkable areas etc".  Drawing the
    -- reflection before the top layer is not enough, because most of what has
    -- to cover it -- a bridge deck, a bank, a path -- is in the BOTTOM layer
    -- and was already on screen before the sprite pass began.
    --
    -- So the pass is CLIPPED to the reflective cells.  That is the rule the
    -- cartridge's own priorities produce and it needs no per-tile redrawing:
    -- a reflection is visible exactly where there is water to hold it, and
    -- nowhere else.
    --
    -- WITH THE SCISSOR, NOT THE STENCIL, and that is the whole of why the
    -- first cut of this masking shipped and did nothing.  It called
    -- love.graphics.stencil inside a pcall -- but this engine draws the world
    -- into a canvas built by src/render/PixelCanvas.lua, which asks for no
    -- depth/stencil buffer, so the stencil call THREW on every frame, the
    -- pcall swallowed it, and the fallback drew the reflections unmasked.
    -- The symptom was a masking pass that appeared to be installed and had
    -- never once run.
    --
    -- The scissor has no such requirement and costs nothing here, because
    -- what has to be clipped is a set of axis-aligned 16x16 cells -- a
    -- rectangle each, which is precisely what a scissor is.  It is set per
    -- cell and intersected with whatever clip the caller already had, so a
    -- reflection is painted once per water cell it falls across.
