-- Emerald's party screen.
--
-- Not the Gen 2 list.  That screen is six rows down a Game Boy letterbox;
-- this one is six PANELS on a 240x160 GBA screen, with the lead one large on
-- the left and the other five stacked to its right, and a CANCEL button in
-- the corner.  The shape is the point: on the cartridge you can see at a
-- glance which one is out front.
--
-- WHAT THE CARTRIDGE SUPPLIES is the vocabulary, found the same way the
-- START menu's was -- a run of labels sitting end to end in the text region:
--
--   SHIFT  SEND OUT  SWITCH  SUMMARY  MOVES  ENTER  NO ENTRY  TAKE  READ
--   TRADE
--
-- That run is battle entries and field entries together, so which of them a
-- given press offers is a decision this file makes; the WORDS are not
-- invented, which is the half that would otherwise be wrong in a way nobody
-- would notice.
--
-- IN BATTLE the same screen answers, and it has to: a Hoenn player who
-- pressed POKeMON mid-fight was getting Kanto's six-row Game Boy list, in
-- the middle of an Emerald battle, because this screen only knew how to be
-- opened from the START menu.  The three shapes the battle asks for are the
-- cartridge's own, and the run above names two of them:
--
--   * a VOLUNTARY switch (POKeMON from the battle menu) offers SHIFT --
--     one mon is already out, and the pick takes its place
--   * a FORCED one (the mon fainted) offers SEND OUT, and the pick is
--     immediate: Emerald does not stop to ask
--   * an ITEM's target (`pickOnly`) is picked with no submenu at all
--
-- SHIFT and SEND OUT being two different words for what looks like the same
-- action is exactly the sort of thing that would have been written as one,
-- and the cartridge lists them separately.
--
-- What is NOT derived is the geometry.
--
-- THE ICONS ARE, NOW.  The little bouncing sprites were the one sheet the
-- import never opened -- gMonIconTable, six shared palettes, two frames each
-- -- so a Hoenn party was six panels of text with a blank where the Pokemon
-- should be.  extractMonIcons writes them and icons.bySpecies names them; the
-- bounce below is this port's, since the cartridge's is a sprite-callback
-- rather than data.

--     (96, 8+24n) 144x24.
--   sPartyMenuSpriteCoords (0615704) gives the four sprites inside it in
--     PIXELS: the icon, the held item, the status pill and the ball behind
--     the icon.
--
-- Three tiles is twenty-four pixels; both tables step by that.
