-- Professor Birch's introduction: Emerald's NEW GAME.
--
-- Not OakSpeech with a different professor.  Oak's is a Game Boy sequence
-- built out of a pic area, a NIDORINO show-off, a shrink animation and a
-- walk-on; Birch's is a man standing on a grass platform who asks two
-- questions and steps aside.  The two share the engine's text box, its menu
-- and its naming screen, and nothing else worth sharing.
--
-- EVERY PART OF THIS COMES OUT OF THE CARTRIDGE.
--
--   * the platform is the scene the intro loads, palettes and all;
--   * Birch is the one sprite in 16 MiB loaded as {palette, then a template
--     whose sheet is a raw 0x800 bytes} -- there is no table he is in;
--   * the boy and the girl are the last two rows of gTrainerFrontPicTable;
--   * and the seven lines are the printable strings the intro code loads,
--     found around the one that splices the player's name in, in the order
--     the code loads them.  They are read here BY POSITION, which is the one
--     thing this file assumes: line 4 asks the boy-or-girl question and line
--     5 asks for a name, because that is the order Birch says them in.
--
-- What it does not have is the fade-and-shrink into the overworld.  The
-- player lands in the truck the same way a warp does.
