-- EMERALD'S SCREENS, WHEREVER THEY ARE ASKED FOR
--
-- Each of these ids has a GBA version, and until now the ONLY thing that knew
-- so was `field.boot.screens` -- a snapshot table read in exactly one place,
-- Gen3StartMenu:buildRows.  That is thin in two ways, and both of them showed
-- up on screen:
--
--   * EVERY OTHER CALL SITE HARDCODES THE GAME BOY ID.  BagMenu pushes
--     "PartyMenu" to pick an item's target, a script pushes it to choose a
--     mon, PartyMenu pushes "SummaryMenu" for STATS.  None of them consults
--     the boot record, so on a Gen 3 cache those routes opened the Game Boy
--     screen -- a Gen 1 stats page with FOUR stats and a single SPECIAL, for
--     an Emerald Pokemon that has six.
--   * AND ONE MISSING BOOT RECORD TAKES ALL OF THEM AT ONCE.  boot.screens is
--     built during Data:seedDefaults and lives on data.field; anything that
--     leaves that table without one -- a cache shape the seed did not run
--     for, a reload, a mod that replaces field -- silently reverts the bag,
--     the party menu and the trainer card together, which is exactly what it
--     looks like.
--
-- So the mapping moves here, where every push goes through it, and it is
-- derived from the DATASET rather than from a record something has to have
-- remembered to write.
--
-- `opts` IS PART OF THE DECISION.  Emerald's party menu is the START MENU's
-- party menu: it lists the party and it closes.  It does not do the Game
-- Boy screen's SWITCH/STATS/ITEM submenu, forced switch-ins, item targeting
-- or TM teaching, and handing it one of those calls would open a screen that
-- ignores the callback and strands the player.  So an alias declares which
-- options its screen actually serves, and a push carrying anything else stays
-- on the screen that implements it.  That is a smaller lie than the one it
-- replaces: a Game Boy party menu in a Hoenn battle is wrong, but a Hoenn
-- party menu that cannot switch is BROKEN.
-- WHICH PUSHES EACH GEN 3 SCREEN CAN ANSWER, by the option keys it reads.
--
-- The list is deliberately a whitelist rather than "anything": a push
-- carrying an option the Gen 3 screen does not implement would open a screen
-- that silently ignored it, and a party menu that ignores `tmhm` is worse
-- than one that declines and lets the older screen serve.
--
-- The battle keys were the gap the player actually felt.  Pressing POKeMON
-- or BAG mid-fight pushes `battle` (and `onSwitch`, `forceSwitch` or
-- `pickOnly` with it); with those absent here the push declined every time,
-- and an Emerald battle opened Kanto's Game Boy party list.
