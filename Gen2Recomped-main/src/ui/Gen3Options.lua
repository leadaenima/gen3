-- Emerald's OPTION screen.
--
-- Six rows and CANCEL, and every word on it -- the row names and the values
-- each row cycles through -- is read off the cartridge:
--
--   TEXT SPEED    SLOW / MID / FAST
--   BATTLE SCENE  ON / OFF
--   BATTLE STYLE  SHIFT / SET
--   SOUND         MONO / STEREO
--   BUTTON MODE   NORMAL / LR / L=A
--   FRAME         TYPE 1 .. 20
--   CANCEL
--
-- The ROWS are not in that order in the ROM -- BUTTON MODE sits after CANCEL
-- in memory -- so the order above is stated by the extractor rather than
-- read, and the suite checks it against the screen. The vocabulary is the
-- part that would otherwise have been invented, and it is the part derived.
--
-- Which of these the engine can actually honour is a separate question and
-- an honest one: TEXT SPEED, BATTLE SCENE, BATTLE STYLE and SOUND map onto
-- options this port already has. BUTTON MODE and FRAME are stored and shown
-- and do nothing yet, and this file says so rather than hiding the rows --
-- a screen missing two of its six lines is a worse lie than two lines that
-- do not bite.

  -- that cannot reach those has lost every setting the other versions have,

    -- stopped there, so on Emerald -- and nowhere else -- every row a mod
    -- adds was missing and every row a mod takes away was still on screen.

    -- With the voxel mod installed that was eight rows absent (WATER,
    -- ANTI-ALIAS, V-GRID, CURVE, 3D-BTL, BACK SPRITES, DAYTIME, VR) and two
    -- dead rows present (TILT and GBC FX, which that mod holds at zero for
