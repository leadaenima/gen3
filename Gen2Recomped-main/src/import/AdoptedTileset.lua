-- Reading another imported cartridge's tilesets, for maps copied out of it.
--
-- WHY THIS IS IN src/ AND NOT WITH THE MAP EDITOR.
--
-- The editor copies a map out of one game into another -- Cerulean Cave from
-- Blue into Crystal -- and the map is meaningless without the tileset it is
-- drawn against, so the tileset is ADOPTED: registered here under a namespaced
-- id (`TilesetCavern@blue`) that cannot collide with a local one.
--
-- The art is NOT COPIED. Every version's cache is a folder beside this one's,
-- so `blue/assets/generated/tilesets/x.png` is already visible; the record
-- holds a path into the other game's cache and the pixels stay where the
-- importer put them.
--
-- That has a consequence the editor cannot answer for on its own: a mod
-- EXPORTED from those edits carries the reference, and the person installing it
-- has to have imported the same cartridge or there is nothing behind the path.
-- The exported mod therefore has to do this resolution itself, at load, on
-- someone else's machine -- and `tools/` is not in a player build (see
-- scripts/pack_love.sh, which ships only tools/save-editor and the ROM
-- manifests). A mod that required the editor's copy of this logic would work
-- for the author and for nobody else.
--
-- So the logic lives here, where both callers reach it: the editor while
-- adopting, and an exported mod while resolving what the editor adopted.
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE WILL NOT DO. It will not put cartridge content anywhere it
-- can be redistributed. It reads the RECIPIENT's own extraction and hands back
-- a record pointing into it. An export carries the reference -- which game,
-- which tileset -- and never the blocks, the collision or the pixels; those
-- are the cartridge's, and the same rule the repository applies to itself
-- (.gitignore excludes data/generated, assets/generated, the example mod's
-- sprites and even screenshots, "so they are ROM content") applies to anything
-- this engine hands one player to give to another.

-- and "it did not work" is not an answer anyone can act on.
--
-- THE ART PATH IS CHECKED BEFORE THE RECORD IS HANDED BACK. A tileset

-- failure than refusing: the map loads, every block is blank, and there is
-- nothing to suggest the cause is a missing import.
-- Build the adopted record from a tileset table already in hand.
--
-- SPLIT FROM `resolve` BECAUSE THE CALLERS DIFFER IN WHAT THEY HAVE, not in
-- what they want. The editor has already opened the source game and holds its
-- tilesets; an exported mod, on someone else's machine, has only a name. Both
-- need the identical record out the other end -- same art-path rewrite, same
-- validation -- and having two places build it is how they drift.
-- THE ELEVATION EDGES, which travel with the tileset and had nowhere else to
-- ride.
--
-- Gen 1 has no collision classes. What stops the player walking off a Cerulean
-- Cave ledge onto the floor below is `TilePairCollisionsLand` -- a list of
-- tile PAIRS that may not be crossed in either direction, five of them for
-- CAVERN alone -- and both tiles in every one of those pairs is individually
-- walkable. Take the list away and the cliffs are not cliffs; they are a
-- change of drawing.
--
-- It lives in `field.lua`, not in the tileset record, and it is keyed by the
-- tileset's PLAIN name. So a map adopted into a Gen 2 build lost it twice
-- over: Crystal's own `field.lua` has no `tilePairs` key at all, and even with
-- one the rows say "CAVERN" while the adopted set is called "CAVERN@red".
-- Cerulean Cave imported from Red arrived as a cave whose terraces you could
-- step straight up onto from any side.
--
-- Read from the SOURCE cartridge's cache, filtered to this tileset, and
-- carried on the record -- which is where `Collision.pairBlocked` now looks
-- first. Nothing is redistributed by this: the rows come out of whichever
-- machine is doing the resolving, exactly like the blocks and the art path.
