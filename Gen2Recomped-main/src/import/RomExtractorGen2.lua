--                             running to MapObjectPals
--   EnvironmentColorsPointers 8 words, one per ENVIRONMENT_* (1-based: 1 TOWN,
--                             2 ROUTE, 3 INDOOR, 4 CAVE, 5 ENV_5, 6 GATE,
--                             7 DUNGEON), each -> a 4x8 byte table of INDICES

--                             row (index 7 being the white text palette).
--
-- So the stride is 8 palettes, not 7, and which palettes a map gets is decided
-- by its ENVIRONMENT byte and the clock -- not by pattern-matching the tileset
-- name.  Reading it the old way put caves 14 palettes into the table and
-- indoor maps 28 in (nearly black).
--
-- And the base address was hardcoded to Gold's 02:$775E.  Crystal's
-- TilesetBGPalette is at 02:$7319, so every Crystal tile came out of unrelated
-- bytes -- that is the garish red/green/pink overworld.  Everything below

-- TWO DECOMPRESSORS WEAR THIS ONE FORMAT.
--
-- Gold, Crystal and Prism ship pret's original `_Decompress`: every command's
-- length is `field + 1` and nothing is written before the copy loop.
--
-- Polished Crystal ships a REWRITTEN, unrolled one (00:$08bf) that writes two
-- bytes per iteration, and to make the loop count come out its LZ_ITERATE
-- writes the run byte ONCE before entering `fill` (00:$0980 `ld [hl+],a`) and
-- its LZ_ALTERNATE writes the pair before jumping into the repeat loop
-- (00:$0911). So the same control byte means `field + 2` bytes there for an
-- iterate and `field + 3` for an alternate.
--
-- Read at the original lengths every stream that uses either command comes up
-- SHORT -- and short is the dangerous direction, because a map's block table
-- is then rejected by gen2LzAt's length gate and the caller falls back to
-- reading the COMPRESSED BYTES AS BLOCKS. Measured on this cartridge: 246 of
-- 605 maps decompressed to exactly width*height at the original lengths and
-- 359 fell between 1 and 23 bytes short; with the two pre-writes, 605 of 605
-- land exactly. Prism is the other way round -- 442 of 450 at the original

-- IS WHAT CAME BACK ACTUALLY A STRING?
--
-- The text scaffold is a list of symbols, and a good number of the ones it
-- carries are not text at all -- ClearPrintTextInitialSP, FarPrintText,
-- CloseText, ConvertMemToText, CreateFullscreenTextbox, BattleCommand_*.
-- Those are ROUTINES. Decoding the bytes at a routine's address yields a
-- string in the sense that every byte maps to something, and it is machine
-- code: 93 distinct unknown codes over 19,480 occurrences in one Prism import,
-- spread flat across the byte range rather than concentrated the way real
-- control codes are.
--
-- The damage is not cosmetic. A script that points at one of these prints it,
-- which is how ROCK SMASH in a Prism cave came to say
-- "Larvitar[1ac[qAC'sG OLD GOLD." -- the box was faithfully rendering
-- AcquaTutorialFirstSoil_Text, whose stored value really does begin
-- "{BYTE:41}<>{RAM:BC87}(4{RAM:98EC}{USER}{TARGET}?{USER}".
--
-- So a decode that does not look like text is REFUSED and the placeholder is
-- left standing, which the cleanup at the end of this stage turns into the
-- titleised symbol name. A box reading "Acqua Tutorial First Soil Text" is
-- plainly a gap in the port; one reading "[1ac[qAC's" looks like the save is
-- corrupt. The first is also reportable: it names the symbol that failed.
--
-- Two signals, both chosen to be safe on real dialogue:
--
--   * a RAW-ADDRESS RAM token. Legitimate ones are named --
--     {RAM:wStringBuffer1} -- because the decoder resolved the address against
--     the symbol table. {RAM:BC87} means it did not, i.e. not a text stream.
--   * a high DENSITY of unknown bytes. Real text occasionally carries one
--     ("Are you sure you{BYTE:63}wish to continue?" is genuine); a routine is
--     a third of the way unknown. Three or more AND over a tenth of the
--     visible length, so one stray code never costs a line.
--
-- Measured over a real Prism import: 552 of 7,773 entries refused, every
-- sampled one junk, and the 93 entries that keep a stray unknown byte are all
-- real dialogue.
--
-- On the module rather than a file local: this chunk is already at Lua's
-- 200-local ceiling for a main function.

-- The shape, from the cartridge: a text is ordinary charmap bytes until $5D
-- (`<CTXT>`), and everything after that byte is the Huffman bit stream. So a
-- line is not one encoding or the other -- it is the beginning of the sentence
-- in plain bytes and the rest of it compressed:
--
--   "Look" $5D <bits...>   ->  "Look! Check out my\nbag!..."
--   "W"    $5D <bits...>   ->  "Which photo is on\nyour Trainer Card?"
--
-- That second one is why reading the stream on its own is not enough: decoding
-- from the $5D onwards drops the "W" and reads the marker itself as data,
-- which turns "Which photo" into "o hich photo" -- readable enough to look
-- like a near miss and wrong at the first character.
--
-- $08 (`<FAR>`) is followed by `dw address, db bank` and continues there,
-- which is how the short entry in a script bank reaches the real line in a
-- text bank.

  -- Get3DPrismShade write OBJ tiles, Toggle3DPrismPage double-buffers them
  -- across two VRAM pages, and InitializeBackground places the 29 OAM entries
  -- that show them.  The cartridge stores no frames of it: _TitleScreen
  -- explicitly zeroes 70 tiles of BOTH object planes at startup.
  --
  -- What CAN be carried across is where it lives and what it is coloured
  -- with, so the renderer can draw the same solid in the same place out of
  -- the same palette.  The block is the five tiles the cover reserves on row
  -- 12 (`hlbgcoord 7, 12 / ld bc, 5`) by the seven rows the band spans, and
  -- the OAM attributes InitializeBackground writes are palettes 1, 2 and 3 --
  -- one per visible face, which is what makes the rotation read as a solid.
  -- WHERE IT SITS AND WHAT SHAPE IT IS, both read off InitializeBackground
  -- rather than guessed.  It writes 29 OAM entries as SEVEN columns of 8x16

  -- -$c.  Every column therefore ENDS at the same y, so the silhouette is
  -- flat-bottomed with a stepped top rising to the middle: a cut gem, which
  -- is what AnimateTitleCrystal calls it.
  --
  -- That routine then slides all 29 down 2px a frame until the first entry
  -- reaches $2c, which is +56 from where it starts.  Screen coordinates are
  -- OAM minus (8, 16), so the gem comes to rest spanning x 52..108 and

--          and relights ONE of them, running colours 1-3 up the BWFade /
--          BlackLBlueFade / BlackBlueFade ramps against a triangle counter --
--          which is the eyes opening in the dark.  Those screens are stored as
--          a white-on-black mask and tinted at draw time.

-- TilesetTowerAnim (3F:$4297) is ten rows of `dw <dest>, AnimateTowerPillarTile`

-- tileset's tiles are re-written every animation step.  The routine (3F:$4645)
-- reads `wTileAnimationTimer & 7`, indexes TowerPillarTileFrameOffsets --
-- 0, 16, 32, 48, 64, 48, 32, 16 -- and copies the 16 bytes at that offset into
-- VRAM: five distinct frames played 0 1 2 3 4 3 2 1, which is the sway going
-- out and coming back.
--
-- Written out as one strip, ten columns (one per animated tile, in the order
-- the runtime lists them) by five rows (one per frame), because the renderer
-- patches whole-atlas clones from it.

--   BattleTowerTrainers (7E:$414E)  70 records of 11 bytes -- a 10 byte name
--     padded with $50, then the trainer class.  70 is not a guess: the roll in
--     LoadOpponentTrainerAndPokemon is `Random & $7F` rejected at >= $46, and
--     $414E + 70 * 11 lands exactly on BattleTowerMons.
--   BattleTowerMons (7E:$4450)  level groups of 21 battle_tower_mon.  Each
--     record is 59 bytes: a 48 byte party_struct followed by an 11 byte
--     nickname, which is dropped here because ReadBTTrainerParty (5C:$42B7)
--     overwrites it with the species name before the battle starts.  21 is the
--     `Random & $1F` rejected at >= $15 in LoadRandomBattleTowerMon, and 1239
--     (= 21 * 59) is the stride that routine adds per level group.
--   BTTrainerClassGenders (47:$72F0)  one byte per trainer class - 1; nonzero
--     picks the female line pool in BattleTowerText (47:$4000).
--   BTMaleTrainerTexts / BTFemaleTrainerTexts  three slots -- before the
--     battle, on the opponent winning, on the opponent losing -- each a table
--     of 25 (male) or 15 (female) lines.  BattleTowerText rolls the line ONCE,
--     for slot 1, and reuses that index for the other two, so an opponent's
--     three lines belong to one personality.
--
-- Stats are not stored: the DVs and stat exp are, and Stats.calc reproduces
-- the ROM's own stat block from them exactly (checked against the precomputed
-- stats sitting at offsets 34..47 of each record).

-- row-major by TrainerCard_Page2_3_OAMUpdate's .facing1 template; the rest
-- are the spin frames a still card has no use for.
--
-- The leader sheet is eight groups of ten.  TrainerCard_Page2_3_PlaceLeadersFaces
-- writes four consecutive tile ids, steps hl by $11, writes three, steps by
-- $11 again and writes three -- on a 20-wide tilemap that is row 0 columns

-- little number plate and tiles 1-9 are the gym leader's head, three by three,
-- in the columns beside it.  That is what the user sees on a real card: the
-- LEADERS' FACES are the badge page, and the badge itself is an OAM sprite
-- laid over the face -- TrainerCard_JohtoBadgesOAM puts it at screen x 16,
-- y 88, which is the slot's own column, one tile row down.
--
-- Colour is _CGB_TrainerCard's: it loads the CHRIS, FALKNER, WHITNEY, BUGSY,
-- MORTY, PRYCE, JASMINE and CHUCK entries of TrainerPalettes into BG slots
-- 0-7, then paints the eight 4x2 badge boxes with slots 1-7 -- the eighth
-- (Clair's) keeps the screen fill, which is slot 1, Falkner.  Baking it in

-- decode graphics, and every one of them runs AFTER all the data is already
-- written.  A single bad sheet in one of those used to abort the whole import
-- -- three separate times against Prism, each a different decode2bpp assert
-- (a 61px sheet, a 192-byte payload for a 128-byte frame) -- throwing away a
-- complete, correct extraction at the very last step over one cosmetic tile.
--
-- So asset stages are allowed to fail: log which one, keep the placeholder art
-- that stage would have replaced, and finish.  A game with one wrong sprite is
-- worth far more than no game at all.
--
-- Table fields, not `local`s: this chunk is at Lua 5.1's 200-local ceiling.
