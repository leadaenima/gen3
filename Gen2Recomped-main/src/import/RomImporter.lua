-- v17: Force a fresh Gen2 re-import after tileset registry and map-id fixes.
-- v32: item ItemAttributes property bits (CANT_SELECT / CANT_TOSS).
-- v33: shiny half of each PokemonPalettes row (MON_<id>_SHINY).
-- v34: SPRITE_MON_nnn defs for every species, for the day-care yard.
-- v35: trainer class pics bake their TrainerPalettes colors on every
--      platform (ImageWriter.recolorShades no longer keys on float
--      equality, which missed on Android and left the pics DMG grey).
-- v36: warps are decoded from the cart's MapEvents instead of the scaffold,
--      which now ships empty so no map geometry is committed.
-- v38: `writecmdqueue` resolves its CMDQUEUE_STONETABLE rows, so a Strength
--      boulder pushed onto a hole knows which script to run (Ice Path,
--      Blackthorn Gym).
-- v39: UnownFont + UnownWords for the Pokédex's UNOWN MODE.
-- v40: UnownWords are tile ids, not charmap text, and the font rip keeps the
--      ROM's stored polarity.
-- v41: battle animation `anim_loop` rows carry their jump target.
-- v42: Gen2 map defs carry their MapGroupPointers (group, number) pair, which
--      is what a Gold/Silver battery save stores as the player's location
--      (src/save_convert/Gen2Save.lua).
-- v43: field.engineFlags (the EngineFlags address/bit rows) and
--      field.spawnFlags (wVisitedSpawns bit -> map), so an imported battery
--      save carries every ENGINE_* flag and its FLY destinations.
-- v44: battle animation framesets stop at `oamdelete` ($FC) and carry
--      `oamwait` ($FD) rows as blanks instead of reading both as OAM ids.
-- v45: two Crystal-only additions.  field.playerForms carries KRIS's whole
--      asset set (card portrait, intro pic, back pic, default names) so the
--      Oak speech can ask boy/girl, and pokemon[*].picAnim plus
--      assets/generated/battle/anim/*.png carry the front-pic frame
--      animations.  Neither exists in a v44 cache, and without this bump
--      isReady() calls that cache current and the import never re-runs.
-- v46: picAnim for real.  A v45 cache has the playerForms half but NO
--      pokemon[*].picAnim and no assets/generated/battle/anim: the
--      extractor's animation-script reader was named gen2AnimScript, which
--      this file already used for battle MOVE animations, and the later
--      definition silently won -- so every species came back empty.  A v45
--      marker has to be treated as stale or that empty result sticks.
-- v47: Crystal tileset identity.  gen2TilesetNames matched Tilesets entries
--      on the GFX pointer alone, and in Crystal six families share
--      TilesetRuinsOfAlphGFX while TilesetJohtoModern shares its GFX with
--      TilesetBattleTowerOutside -- so every Ruins of Alph map was imported
--      with TilesetAerodactylWordRoom's blocks AND collision (glitched art,
--      and no walkable exit in the inner chamber / item rooms) and every
--      JOHTO_MODERN map (Azalea Town, Goldenrod, Routes 33/34) with
--      TilesetBattleTowerOutside's.  A v46 cache has the wrong blocks baked
--      into data/generated/tilesets.lua and the wrong tileset name baked into
--      data/generated/maps.lua, so it has to be treated as stale.
-- v48: three more things baked into a v47 cache are wrong.
--      * maps[*].mapPalette did not exist, so every indoor map and the Ruins
--        of Alph chambers followed the clock into the NITE palette row
--        instead of the PALETTE_DAY their header forces.
--      * map_scripts.varSprites came back EMPTY on Crystal (the
--        InitializeEventsScript scan looked for Gold's variablesprite opcode
--        $6C and bailed at Crystal's $6D), which is why Route 36's Sudowoodo
--        and Route 37's Twins Ann & Anne -- both wVariableSprites slot 4 --
--        drew as placeholders.  Crystal's initial-event set was truncated at
--        the same byte.
--      * every decoded `getstring` has a byte-swapped string pointer, so the
--        EXPN CARD / RADIO CARD / GEAR / EGG / COIN lines printed a stale
--        buffer.  The literal is resolved at extract time now.
-- v49: a Gen2 tileset is 192 tiles in TWO VRAM banks, and the metatile bytes
--      that reach the second one ($80-$DF) were being read as literal tile
--      numbers.  Both data/generated/tilesets.lua's blocks and its palMap are
--      re-keyed to a flat 0..191 index now, so a v48 cache draws Ecruteak's
--      building fronts, the Burned Tower roof and Elm's desk as blank or
--      garbage until it is rebuilt.  25 of Crystal's 37 tilesets are affected.
-- v50: field.gen2TreeMons was read with Gold's TreeMons pointer-table shape on
--      both ROMs.  A v49 Crystal cache has no sets 3-7 at all -- so the nine
--      set-3 routes (29/30/31/34-39), Routes 26/27/32, Route 43, Lake of Rage
--      and Ilex Forest have no headbutt table to roll against -- and files
--      TreeMonSet_Route as the rock-smash list.
-- v51: the two player characters wore each other's colours.
--      * registerGen2KrisSprites' skip guard was `sprites[id] and nil or
--        spriteDefFor(...)`, which in Lua is just `spriteDefFor(...)` -- so it
--        overwrote Crystal's real SPRITE_KRIS / SPRITE_KRIS_BIKE (rows 96/97,
--        OBJ palette 1, blue) with a clone of Chris's row 1 on palette 0.  A
--        v50 cache has no sprite at index 96 at all.
--      * the boy's gender-select pic was left for the SGB zone shader to
--        colour instead of being baked from PlayerPalette, so Chris showed up
--        purple and white.
-- v52: field.gen2BugContest -- the Bug Catching Contest's own encounter table
--      (ContestMons), the nine AI contestants with their score picks, and the
--      20 Park Balls / 20 minutes the ROM hands out.  A v51 cache has none of
--      it, so the contest has nothing to roll against.
-- v53: field.gen2BattleTower -- Crystal's Battle Tower.  The 70 trainers with
--      their classes, genders and overworld sheets; the ten level groups of 21
--      opponents each, with the DVs and stat exp that make their stat blocks
--      the cartridge's own; the male and female line pools; the party rule
--      texts and the two menus.  A v52 cache has none of it, so the tower's
--      scripts have nothing to roll an opponent from.  Gold and Silver have no
--      Battle Tower at all, but they share the marker, so they re-import once
--      too.
-- v54: the player's name in Gen2 dialogue.  Inside a TX_START run the byte
--      $14 is PlaceGenderedPlayerName -- the player's name -- not the
--      TX_STRINGBUFFER command it is at the outer level, so 691 lines carried
--      "{RAM:wStringBuffer1}" where the name belonged and printed whatever the
--      player last picked up ("ELM: POKeGEAR / There you are!").  The operand
--      byte it wrongly ate was usually the "!" after the name.  A v53 cache
--      has the broken text baked into data/generated/text.lua.
-- v55: CHRIS's trainer card portrait and battle back pic, baked in
--      PlayerPalette as battle/chriscard.png and battle/chrisback.png.  The
--      boy form declared trueColor while pointing at the plain four-shade
--      chrisf.png / chrisb.png rips, so the renderer left them alone and both
--      drew in black and white.
-- v56: field.egg.pic.  EggPic decompresses to 47 tiles in Crystal -- 25 of pic
--      and 22 of appended animation frames -- so the "the tile count must be a
--      perfect square" rule threw, field.egg came out with no pic key, and an
--      EGG's stats page drew nothing.  Now read as a declared 5x5 and baked in
--      the egg's own palette.
-- v57: the rest of the v54 player-name fix.  v54 corrected the texts reached
--      through a manifest symbol, but gen2RegisterScriptText -- the path every
--      writetext/jumptext operand takes, and so every line an NPC actually
--      speaks -- skipped the leading $00 before storing the address.  That is
--      TX_START, the byte that opens the PlaceString run where $14 is the
--      player's name, so 152 script texts kept printing the last item picked
--      up where the name belongs.  decodeGen2TextAt now also seeds its mode
--      from the first byte, so a mid-run address decodes correctly whoever
--      hands it over.
-- v58: battle_anims.functions.  DoBattleAnimFrame's 80-entry jumptable was
--      read at Gold's hardcoded $4F1D; Crystal's is at $4FCE, and Crystal's
--      symbols name none of those routines, so the table came out EMPTY.  With
--      no name to look up, every animation object fell through
--      Gen2AnimPlayer's MOTION table to "Null" and stayed exactly where the
--      script spawned it -- no move animation travelled anywhere on Crystal.
--      The address now comes from the symbol and the names from a baked
--      table-order list.
-- v59: two more Gold-shaped assumptions.
--      * object_event sprite bytes $F0 and up are wVariableSprites SLOTS, and
--        naming them after a sheet (SPRITE_ROCKET for $F6) pinned the object to
--        that sheet for the whole game.  $F6 defaults to the Rocket and a
--        script reassigns it to SILVER, so the rival in Azalea Town turned up
--        as a Team Rocket grunt.  They now carry the slot's own constant name,
--        which NPC.lua resolves through save.gen2VarSprites.
--      * field.overworldFx.healMachine.gen2ObjPal came from MapObjectPals[6],
--        but HealMachineAnim.LoadPalettes copies its OWN four colours over
--        palette 6 first -- so the Poke Balls were reading the green tree
--        palette instead of ball red.
-- v60: every Crystal Pokedex entry.  Gold computes the entry's bank as
--      `$68 + group` and really does end GetDexEntryPointer with `add a, $68`;
--      Crystal replaced that with a four-byte lookup ($60, $6E, $73, $74)
--      because its entries are no longer in consecutive banks.  Reading
--      Crystal with Gold's arithmetic put all 251 entries in the wrong bank --
--      VENONAT's came out as Brock's BOULDERBADGE speech.
-- v61: headbutt never dropped a Pokemon.  GetTreeMons (2E:$42D2) is `cp $08 /
--      jr nc, .quit` then `and a / jr z, .quit` -- SEVEN sets are reachable
--      (1 Canyon, 2 Town, 3 Route, 4 Kanto, 5 Lake, 6 Forest, 7 Rock) -- but
--      the extractor kept only sets 1-3 and read index 3 as the rock-smash
--      list.  Index 3 is Route, which TreeMonMaps assigns to NINE maps
--      (Routes 29/30/31/34/35/36/37/38/39, i.e. most of the early game), and
--      Kanto, Lake and Forest were dropped outright -- so Routes 26/27/32,
--      Route 33, Route 42/43, Lake of Rage and Ilex Forest had no table
--      either.  Every one of those maps rolled against a nil set and could
--      only ever answer "Nope. Nothing…".  Rock is set 7 and TreeMonSet_Rock
--      now pins it; it is also the last table in the bank and has no rare
--      half, so the rare read is skipped for it rather than walking on into
--      GetTreeMon's own code.
-- v62: audio.battle carried four themes; PlayBattleMusic (11:$6E6C) picks
--      eleven.  Missing were the rival theme (classes RIVAL $09 and $2A),
--      the Rocket theme (classes $1F and $42), the two Kanto themes and the
--      night-time wild theme -- so Silver, Team Rocket and every Kanto
--      trainer all fought to Music_JohtoTrainerBattle, Kanto gym leaders
--      to the Johto gym theme, and night battles to the day song.
-- v63: map_scripts.phone rows now carry the contact's own map (bytes 3 and 4
--      of the PhoneContacts row).  GetAvailableCallers (36:$40DE) compares it
--      against wMapGroup/wMapNumber to drop a contact who is standing on the
--      map you are on, and RandomPhoneWildMon (0A:$651F) reads that map's
--      grass table for the species its line names.  A v62 cache has neither,
--      so no trainer can ring in and the wild-mon lines have no species.
-- v64: field.gen2Trades -- the seven in-game trades.  NPCTrades (3F:$4E58) is
--      seven 32-byte rows (dialog set, the species wanted, the species given,
--      the nickname, the DVs, the OT id and name, the gender required), and
--      TradeTexts (3F:$4F53) is the five kinds of line times four dialog sets
--      that PrintTradeText indexes.  A v63 cache has none of it, so the
--      `trade` script command -- which was not lowered either -- had nothing
--      to work from and every trade NPC in the game stood silent.
-- v65: three more Gold-shaped or byte-order faults, all in the extractor.
--      * StdScripts was walked as 46 rows, which is GOLD's count.  Crystal has
--        FIFTY-TWO, and the six it adds -- GymStatue2Script, ReceiveItemScript,
--        ReceiveTogepiEggScript, PCScript, GameCornerCoinVendorScript and
--        HappinessCheckScript -- were dropped, so a `jumpstd` to any of them
--        ran nothing.  The count now comes off the table's own first pointer.
--      * `farjumptext`'s operand was typed as a far SCRIPT pointer, so the
--        extractor disassembled the text as bytecode and the operand came out
--        as a script label.  Every bookshelf, sign, window and trash can in
--        Crystal reaches its line through one of those eleven std scripts.
--      * Battle Tower opponents' stat blocks were read one 16-bit field early
--        AND little-endian, so the first L10 opponent had 10496 HP and 6400
--        defense instead of 41 and 24 -- nothing the player did could dent it.
-- v66: field.gen2UnownWalls -- the four words carved into the Ruins of Alph
--      chamber walls.  UnownWalls (22:$6EBC) is four $FF-terminated runs of
--      tile ids and MenuHeaders_UnownWalls (22:$6ED5) is the window each one
--      opens in; DisplayUnownWords, the special the wall scripts run right
--      after "Patterns appear on the wall!", had neither, so the line printed
--      and the writing it announces never appeared.
-- v67: field.gen2OddEggs -- Crystal's fourteen Odd Eggs.  OddEggs (7E:$756E)
--      is fourteen 59-byte records in the battle_tower_mon shape (a 48 byte
--      party_struct then an 11 byte "EGG"), seven species listed twice with
--      the second of each pair carrying the shiny DV pair, and
--      OddEggProbabilities (7E:$7552) is the fourteen cumulative thresholds
--      _GiveOddEgg rolls a 16-bit Random against.  Neither was extracted and
--      `special GiveOddEgg` had no handler, so the DAY-CARE MAN gave his whole
--      speech and the egg never arrived.
-- v68: two corrections and one addition.
--      * MenuHeaders_UnownWalls is Y FIRST.  Word 0's row is $40 $04 $03 $09
--        $10, and only y1 4 / x1 3 / y2 9 / x2 16 gives a window wide enough
--        for six two-tile glyphs -- which is what _CopyWord wants, since its
--        loop ends each glyph with `inc hl / inc hl`, two COLUMNS.  Read the
--        other way round the wall writing came out as a totem pole.
--      * field.gen2MomBank -- Mom's thirteen banking lines.  MomScript's
--        `checkevent $40` branch is `setevent $40 / special BankOfMom /
--        waitbutton / closetext / end` with no writetext in it at all, so
--        without the special AND its text she simply said nothing.
-- v69: field.gen2TileAnim -- SPROUT TOWER's swaying pillar.  TilesetTowerAnim
--      (3F:$427F) is ten `dw <ptr>, AnimateTowerPillarTile` rows and each ptr
--      is `dw <VRAM dest>, dw <frames>`, so one animation step rewrites TEN
--      tiles at once ($5D $5F $4D $4F $3C $2C $3D $3F $2D $2F).  The routine
--      (3F:$4645) takes `wTileAnimationTimer & 7` through the offset table
--      0, 16, 32, 48, 64, 48, 32, 16 -- five 16-byte frames played
--      1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2, the sway going out and coming back again.  Extracted
--      as one 80x40 strip (ten columns, five rows) to
--      assets/generated/tilesets/towerpillar.png.  Nothing read that table
--      before, so the tower's central support stood perfectly still.
-- v71: overworld sprite sheets were being sized from the sprite_header's
--      length byte, which is the VRAM ALLOCATION and not the sheet.  Every
--      walking sheet is declared at half its real size (pokecrystal:
--      `overworld_sprite ChrisSpriteGFX, 12, WALKING_SPRITE` = 192 bytes,
--      gfx/sprites/chris.png = 16x96 = 384), so every one of them extracted
--      as 3 frames instead of 6, `walker` went false, and the player and
--      every NPC in Gold, Silver and Crystal SLID instead of walking.
--      A v70 cache holds those half-height PNGs, so the extractor fix alone
--      changes nothing until the sheets are re-extracted -- which is what
--      this bump is for.  See src/import/RomExtractorGen2.lua's
--      gen2OverworldSprites.
-- v72: field.fishGroups is keyed by the FISHGROUP_* CONSTANT now, not by the
--      row number.  `Fish` runs GetFishGroupIndex (`dec d`) before indexing
--      FishGroups, so row 0 is FISHGROUP_SHORE = 1 -- and the map header byte
--      the runtime looks a group up with is the constant.  Off by one, every
--      map in the game fished the NEXT group's table: Olivine served OCEAN,
--      the Lake of Rage served DRATINI_2, Ilex Forest's Super Rod could land a
--      DRAGONAIR, Corsola and Dratini were uncatchable, and Routes 12 and 13
--      indexed past the end and never got a bite at all.  A v71 cache holds
--      the old keys, so this bump is what makes the fix reach a save.
-- v73: field.overworldFx gains the Gen2 fishing pose and rod (redFishFront /
--      redFishBack / redFishSide / fishingRod from FishingGFX and
--      FishingRodGFX).  Those keys only ever had Gen1 values, so on
--      Gold/Silver/Crystal the player fished in the plain walking sprite with
--      no rod on screen.
--
--      This bump is ALSO the fishing-table safety net.  A cache written before
--      gen2Fishing existed has no field.fishGroups at all, and the runtime then
--      falls through to the Gen1 `fishing` table -- which a Gen2 manifest does
--      not carry -- so every rod on every map answers "Not even a nibble!".
--      That is indistinguishable from the off-by-one v72 fixed, and it is what
--      a stale cache still does.  Re-extracting is the only cure, and the
--      extractor now warns instead of failing silently.
-- v74: two sheets that only the Gen1 extractor ever wrote.
--      * assets/generated/battle/balls.png -- the party ball row's four icons
--        (healthy / statused / fainted / empty), from LoadBallIconGFX.gfx.
--        BattleState:drawBallRow has always wanted it and the coordinates were
--        always right; without the file the image load failed, ballQuads
--        latched false, and BOTH ball rows drew nothing -- so a trainer battle
--        never showed how many Pokemon the foe had left.
--      * playerForms[*].fish -- the three fishing-pose strips per CHARACTER.
--        LoadFishingGFX picks between FishingGFX and KrisFishingGFX off
--        wPlayerGender, and Kris was fishing on Chris's sprite because the
--        pose lived in overworldFx, which has one slot.
-- v75: five Gen2 move effects stopped being aliased onto Gen1 names that threw
--      their weather rules away, and the sandstorm upkeep animation got an id.
--      * $97 EFFECT_SOLARBEAM was CHARGE_EFFECT -- so Solar Beam never skipped
--        its charge turn in sun and was never halved in rain.
--      * $98 EFFECT_THUNDER was PARALYZE_SIDE_EFFECT2 -- the 30% paralysis was
--        right, but Thunder never always-hit in rain nor dropped to 50% in sun.
--      * $84/$85/$86 EFFECT_MORNING_SUN / SYNTHESIS / MOONLIGHT were all
--        HEAL_EFFECT, a flat half of max HP, so the clock and the weather (the
--        whole point of those three moves) did nothing.
--      * battle_anims.misc gains inSandstorm = 267 (ANIM_IN_SANDSTORM, $10b),
--        the animation the end-of-turn sandstorm hit plays.
--      Rain Dance, Sunny Day and Sandstorm themselves needed no cache change:
--      their effect names were already correct, there was simply no handler --
--      which is why they printed "But, it failed!" every time.
-- v76: two script-decoding fixes and one new table.
--      * GOLD ONLY, and it is the serious one: `getnum` was declared as TWO
--        operand bytes.  pokegold's macro is `db \1 ; string_buffer` and
--        nothing else, exactly like Crystal's, so the decoder over-read by one
--        byte and every Gold script DESYNCED from its first getnum onward.
--      * src.gen2BugContest gains contestantFlags -- the ten event-flag ids
--        from BugCatchingContestantEventFlagTable, which
--        SelectRandomBugContestContestants needs to pick the five entrants.
--        They differ between Gold (1121+) and Crystal (1146+), so they have to
--        be read off the cartridge rather than hardcoded.
-- v77: polished crystal -- ROM font sheets, BattleExtras HUD, the 220-entry
-- opcode table with handler-verified widths, kind-3/kind-5 objects, the
-- layout-driven scripts list, initial events, day periods, and the chunked
-- LuaWriter -- every generated file changes, so every cache must rebuild.
-- v78: the $BE/$BF charmap rows carried "M"/"F" instead of the gender
-- symbols and hijacked the letters; the fix lives in the manifest charmap,
-- which is baked into the generated text and font records.
-- v79: the accented-e charmap row, text-command operand decoding (TX_RAM
-- and friends), the ROM-derived textbox border, three player forms, and
-- the 1:1 object script ids -- text, font and field records all change.
-- v80: polished crystal's SPECIES-DATA layouts, read off the cartridge:
-- the 34-byte no-dex-number BaseData (stats/types/growth/packed gender all
-- layout-keyed), $FF-terminated species-word EvosAttacks (real learnsets
-- instead of the ACROBATICS fallback), 8-byte move rows with the category
-- byte and plain-percent accuracy, offset-table TypeNames, 3-byte dex
-- pointers + PokemonBodyData measures, the bg-event renumbering (kind 7 is
-- jumptext, items ride the kind byte), movement-table actions (cut trees
-- draw the tree frame, $12/$13 are the real rocks, $18/$19 spinners), and
-- the "+" charmap row -- pokemon, moves, maps, map_scripts and text all
-- change.
-- v81: polished crystal's MOVE-EFFECT numbering, read off MoveEffectsPointers
-- (09:$72b5) instead of Crystal's static table -- Growl's effect byte $39 was
-- Crystal's TRANSFORM_EFFECT, so status/stat moves misfired ("used Growl,
-- transformed into Cyndaquil"); moves.lua changes for every affected move.
-- v104: Emerald's move rows gained `highCrit` (effect 43/200/209), and the
-- three effect numbers the Gen 2 join named behaviourally wrong got their
-- pret names -- 196 EFFECT_LOW_KICK (was FLINCH_SIDE_EFFECT2, and Gen 3's
-- Low Kick is weight-based with power 1), 43 EFFECT_HIGH_CRITICAL (was
-- NO_ADDITIONAL_EFFECT) and 104 EFFECT_TRIPLE_KICK.  moves.lua changes.
-- v105: the bike terrain -- every tileset pair gained muddySlopeBehaviour
-- ($D0) and acroObstacles ($D1/$D3-$D6), and constants gained gen3Bike.
-- tilesets.lua and constants.lua change.
-- v106: MB_MT_PYRE_HOLE joins the fall-through holes (it was warping as a
-- door), and every tileset pair gained escalatorBehaviours ($6A/$6B).
-- tilesets.lua and constants.lua change.
-- v107: constants gained gen3MetatileText (the wall region map, the
-- television and the running-shoes booklet) and gen3Questionnaire -- the four
-- lines no script in Hoenn references, because only C code prints them.
-- v108: the water currents south of Pacifidlog (currentBehaviours,
-- constants.gen3Currents) and the ground the RUNNING SHOES refuse
-- (noRunBehaviours, constants.gen3NoRunning).  tilesets.lua and
-- constants.lua change.
-- v109: constants gained gen3WeatherNames and gen3BattleWeather -- the map
-- header's weather byte had no name anywhere in the engine, so the 90 maps
-- that set one were all clear skies.  constants.lua changes.
-- v110: every item row gained `keyItem` (gItems[].importance ~= 0).  The bag
-- and the mart have always asked for that name and Gen 3 wrote only the
-- number, so every key item in Hoenn could be tossed and sold.  items.lua
-- changes.
-- v111: constants gained `badges` -- Hoenn's eight, under the flag names the
-- save writes them as.  Without it Badges.list fell back to KANTO'S eight and
-- the trainer card showed no badge ever earned.  constants.lua changes.
-- v112: the ART FINALLY REACHES THE ENGINE.  Every species row gained
-- spriteFront/spriteBack/spriteShiny (the pictures were written on every
-- import and no row named them, so Sprites.path answered nil for all 386 and
-- there was no mon on the battle screen, the summary, the party or the dex);
-- every trainer row's `pic` is now the PATH rather than the raw
-- gTrainerFrontPicTable index, which the image cache could not use; and
-- constants.gen3Bag is MERGED by its two writers instead of the later one
-- wiping the earlier one's picture.  pokemon.lua, trainers.lua and
-- constants.lua all change.
-- v167: the round of Emerald parity that starts with the box wallpapers.
-- constants gained gen3BoxWallpapers (all thirty-two, plus the rectangle they
-- go in and the grid that sits on them) and assets/generated/storage/ gained
-- their thirty-two pictures; gen3SpritePriority (the elevation-to-priority
-- tables and the field's background priorities, which is what puts a walker
-- ON a bridge instead of under it); gen3GabbyAndTy; gen3AbnormalWeather; and
-- gen3PCMenu gained `orders`, `screen` and `multichoice`.  map_scripts gained
-- the script the field runs for a PC, which no map header names.  A cache
-- built before this has none of the art and none of the records, so the box
-- screen draws a flat rectangle and the storm never appears -- which is why
-- this is a bump rather than a note.
-- v168: the "!" bubble, and the two beside it.  An emote is NOT a field
-- object -- it is a field EFFECT, and its picture is reached only by
-- disassembling the native the effect script calls -- so the three overworld
-- emotes (exclamation, question, heart) had no art anywhere in the cache and
-- every startled trainer, every wondering NPC and every Pokemon in love drew
-- the Game Boy sheet's bubble instead.  constants gained gen3Emotes and
-- assets/generated/overworld/ gained the three pictures.  Nothing but a fresh
-- import can produce them, which is what makes this a bump.
-- v169: THE DECORATIONS -- all 121 of gDecorations, found by its own shape
-- (121 records of 32 bytes whose first byte is the record's index) because no
-- symbol names it.  constants gained gen3Decorations: the name, price, shape,
-- permission, category and description of every one.  Without it `checkdecor`
-- answered "you own none" to every script that hands one over,
-- `bufferdecorationname` printed a hole, and `adddecoration` recorded a number
-- nothing could read back.  A cache built before this has no catalogue at all,
-- so this is a bump.
-- v170: FLASH.  constants gained gen3Flash -- the nine radii, the two levels a
-- cave uses and the screen centre the circle is drawn on, all read off the
-- cartridge's own window setter and SetDefaultFlashLevel.  A dark cave in
-- Hoenn is a black window with a hole in it, not the Game Boy's flat shade,
-- and without this record the field has no radius to cut and falls back to
-- leaving the cave lit.
-- v171: the POKEMON CENTER'S HEALING MACHINE, which is a field effect rather
-- than the OAM table the Game Boy importers read -- two sprites made by machine
-- code and placed by four immediates inside it, so nothing on the machine ever
-- lit up in Hoenn.  constants gained gen3HealMachine and
-- assets/generated/overworld/ gained the glow and the monitor's two frames.
-- Where they go is measured from the player's own cell, and that point comes
-- from the FLASH circle's centre in the record above -- so this needs v170's
-- data as well as its own.
-- v172: THE ROTATING GATES, which is the data half of Fortree Gym's puzzle and
-- the Trick House's sixth room -- nineteen gates the port did not have, so the
-- sixth Gym was a walk across an empty floor.  constants gained
-- gen3RotatingGates: where each gate stands, which of the eight shapes it is,
-- which way it faces, and what each shape's arms reach.  The puzzle itself --
-- walking into an arm, the turn, the collision -- is the next slice; this is
-- the part that cannot be guessed.
-- v173: SLATEPORT'S TRAINER FAN CLUB -- eight members and a counter packed
-- into one halfword, read off the four specials that use it, plus the six
-- names behind its two switches.  Sixty-four call sites in one building said
-- "I'm a big fan of ." before this.  constants gained gen3FanClub, and
-- gen3StartMenu gained `pokenavFlag` -- the flag the cartridge's row builder
-- actually tests, since the name the port had could never be true.
-- v174: WHICH TRAINERS FIGHT TWO AT A TIME.  A map object already carried the
-- trainer it fights; it now also carries the trainerbattle MODE that starts
-- the fight (gen3TrainerKind).  Modes 4, 6, 7 and 8 are the double battles,
-- and CheckTrainer (0B3D6E) reads that same byte off the object's script to
-- decide that one twin alone is already a double and no partner should be
-- looked for.  Without it nothing on the sight path could tell a twin from
-- anybody else.
-- v175: WHERE EVERYTHING IN A BATTLE STANDS -- and one panel that has been
-- wrong in every single battle since the HUD stage was written.  There are
-- FIVE distinct healthbox blobs in the sheet run, not two: the player's
-- single-battle box is 4096 bytes (two 64x64 sprites, and the only one with
-- an EXP bar), and the stage filtered on 2048 -- so it threw that one away
-- and saved the DOUBLES box as `player.png`.  The EXP bar art was never
-- extracted at all, and the opponent was decided by a table.sort on two
-- equal tags, which Lua does not define an order for.  All five are now
-- named by size and tag the way the load site at 05DFFC names them.
-- constants gained gen3BattlerCoords: sBattlerCoords (0525F58) for where the
-- four Pokemon stand, and the six healthbox places read back off the
-- instructions InitBattlerHealthboxCoords (072B18) loads them with.  The
-- single-battle foe comes out at x=176, which is exactly the platform centre
-- the placement test scans out of the drawn background -- code and art
-- agreeing on one number.
-- v176: THE PARTY MENU'S OWN SCREEN.  Reported from play: "still missing the
-- background and pokemon tiles for the emerald pokemon party menu".  The
-- icons were ripped a while back; the screen they sit on never was, and
-- Gen3PartyMenu.lua said so in its own header -- "RECONSTRUCTED, not
-- derived: the panels".  Six boxes this port drew itself, at coordinates it
-- chose itself, on a flat fill.  constants gained gen3PartyMenu: the 62-tile
-- sheet, its 32x32 tilemap and all ELEVEN palettes; the five panel maps
-- (wide, narrow, an egg variant of each, and the empty slot) which are
-- arrays of tile INDICES rather than pictures; the ball that sits behind
-- each icon and opens on the cursor slot; and the two tables that say where
-- everything goes -- sPartyMenuWindowTemplates in tiles and
-- sPartyMenuSpriteCoords in pixels, stepping three and twenty-four
-- respectively, which is the same pitch read two ways.
-- v177: FOUR THINGS THE PORT COULD NOT DO, AND ONE IT DID WRONG.
--
-- THE SEALED CHAMBER.  Reported: "make sure the sealed chamber event works to
-- unlock the regi doors, it is a prerequisite".  It is, and this port had no
-- DIG braille wall at all -- so flag $8AF was never set, the inner room was
-- unreachable, $E4 was never set, and the ON_LOAD of Routes 105, 111 and 120
-- kept writing an impassable metatile ONTO THE WARP CELL of each ruin.  All
-- three Regis were walled off from outside, forever.  gen3RegiChambers gained
-- `sealedChamber`, decoded from DoBrailleDigEffect -- whose six tiles are the
-- Regi door's own, which is what proves it is the same door.  gen3FieldMoves
-- gained DIG, which is a TM and therefore has no badge, which is why the
-- HM-keyed table never had it.
--
-- MAP SEAMS.  Two edges in Hoenn carry TWO connections -- Route 111's west
-- and Route 124's east -- and only the first was kept, so both were one-way:
-- the neighbour was drawn across the seam and could not be entered.  Every
-- connection is now kept in ROM order and selected the way
-- IsCoordInIncomingConnectingMap does, by which strip covers the player.
--
-- THE POKeDEX ROW.  The lab really does set $861; the start menu asked
-- `Flags.hasPokedex`, which answers for the Game Boy names.  Both gated rows
-- are now read off BuildStartMenuActions itself.
--
-- THE REGION MAP knows what is under the cursor.  GetMapSecIdAt indexes a
-- flat 28x15 table, one byte per cell; the port hit-tested the section
-- rectangles, which are anchors and agree with it for only 413 of 420 cells.
--
-- ...AND THE BAG SCREEN, which was a flat green rectangle and three boxes
-- this port chose the size of.  gen3BagScreen carries the 53-tile sheet, both
-- gendered palettes, and every window rectangle from sDefaultBagWindows.
-- ...AND THE SUMMARY SCREEN'S PLACES.  "the pokemon stats/ summary page the
-- text isnt in the right places" -- and that screen's own comment admitted
-- the method: its numbers were "read off the background this screen now
-- draws".  By eye is exactly as accurate as it sounds.  The right-hand stat
-- column was 26 pixels out, the move names 32, the nickname 79, and both row
-- pitches were wrong (fourteen and thirteen against the cartridge's sixteen),
-- so the fourth line of each page drifted out of its own box.
-- constants gained gen3SummaryWindows: all four WindowTemplate arrays.
-- v179: THE WALL WAS BUILT AND THE KEY WAS NEVER CUT.
--
-- Collision's Acro Bike rule handles all five obstacle behaviours and its own
-- comment said it was written out in full "instead of a `return false` nobody
-- remembers to revisit".  Nobody revisited what was outside it: the bag knew
-- only the Game Boy's BICYCLE so Hoenn's two bikes did nothing when used,
-- `mover.acroBike` was read by the rule and written by nothing, and
-- `p.bikeSpeed` -- the only thing that beats a muddy slope -- was read in one
-- place and set in none.  Jagged Pass's bumpy slopes were a wall to everyone,
-- and behind them are Mt. Chimney and the Magma Hideout.
--
-- gen3FieldMoves also gained DIG properly this time: `move` is the cartridge's
-- move NUMBER, the way every other row holds it, not the name.
-- v181: HOENN'S OTHER HALF.
--
-- "Continue finish the pokenav and the contests next".  Both were absent
-- entirely, and both are mostly DATA the import had never gone looking for:
--
--   * gItemIconTable -- 378 pairs of a 24x24 sheet and a palette, found by
--     the only shape in the cartridge that decompresses to exactly 288 and 32
--     bytes 378 times running.  The bag had a hole cut in its background for
--     these and nothing to put in it.
--   * the POKeNAV: five menus, thirteen button pictures, fourteen row
--     descriptions, the 256-byte condition-radius LUT, the seventeen-row
--     ribbon bit layout with its 25 descriptions, all 21 match call headers
--     with their 107 phone lines, and gRematchTable's 78 rows.
--   * contests: 96 opponents in four ranks of 24 (nine of each post-game
--     only), the 5x5 crowd table, the rank names, the combo starter and
--     follow ids on every move, and the Contest Lady's five.
--   * Pokeblocks: the 25x5 nature/flavour table -- proved by deriving it from
--     each nature's raised and lowered stat and finding all 25 rows agree --
--     and the fourteen colour words.
--
-- ...and the engine side: contest stats on the Pokemon (which is also what
-- makes FEEBAS able to evolve at last), ribbons, the Pokeblock case and the
-- Berry Blender's arithmetic, the rematch step counter and its map-load roll,
-- and the region map's zoom.
-- v182: THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTLE SCREEN, AND THREE THINGS IN THE BAG.
--
-- "the text in battle doesnt seem to be correct its really dark but its not
-- like that in the real rom, and the text box in battle has a background in
-- the real game but not in ours" -- one missing picture behind both.  The
-- strip is 240x48 with its own tiles, tilemap and palette, and the message on
-- it is WHITE with a dark violet shadow on TEAL; the four actions beside it
-- are dark grey on white, in the player's own OPTIONS frame.  Two colour
-- records, not one, and every string printed twice.
--
-- The tilemap is 32 by SIXTY-FOUR and only eighteen rows carry art -- three
-- runs of six, which the cartridge scrolls between.  That shape is the check.
--
-- ...and the bag: the item picture's box is 32 by TWENTY-EIGHT, so centring a
-- 24-pixel icon in a 32x32 put it two rows low and its right column on the
-- border; the pocket name was drawn four pixels too far down and the pill's
-- own border ran through it; and the selected pocket's dot is a TILE THE
-- CARTRIDGE SWAPS IN -- a 4x4 block that is red for the boy and blue for the
-- girl -- which the importer now finds by asking which unplaced tile differs
-- from the dot by a solid block.  Exactly one does.
-- v183: WHO YOU CAN SEE, AND WHO IS STANDING ON WHAT.
--
-- "all kekleons are visible without using the scope" -- Emerald's invisible
-- KECLEON wear the ordinary KECLEON sprite, and what hides them is their
-- MOVEMENT TYPE, whose step-0 callback sets the object's own invisible bit.
-- Found by walking all eighty-one callbacks -- wrapper to sub-callback to
-- step table to step 0 -- and looking for the four instructions that set bit
-- 5 of byte 1.  Exactly one reaches them.  They still block and still talk,
-- because the cartridge's collision test never looks at whether an object can
-- be seen.
--
-- "some sprites that are on bridges are appearing under them like steven on
-- the bridge next to the kekleon" -- the whole rule was already here and NPCs
-- simply had no elevation to look it up with.  It cannot come off the ground
-- either: a bridge SPAN is elevation 15, which the cartridge refuses to write,
-- so an NPC standing on one would never learn anything from the cell beneath
-- it.  The template's own byte is the answer, and the data says outright who
-- belongs on top of what: every one of Steven's nine appearances in Hoenn is
-- elevation 3 except the Route 120 bridge, which is 4.
--
-- "After battling may ... her sprite stays there even though she drives away
-- on her bike" -- trainerbattle mode 3 ends with `gotopostbattlescript`, not
-- `gotobeatenscript`: it resumes at the byte AFTER its ten-byte record, which
-- is the rest of the cutscene.
-- v184: THE BALL.
--
-- "Pokeball throwing animations dont exist in battle either" / "neither do
-- the capturing shaking etc eniamtions".  The catch MATHS has been right for
-- a long time and none of it was ever shown: the chain is written in Gen 1's
-- and Gen 2's animation SCRIPTS, and a Gen 3 dataset has none of them.
--
-- Twelve sheets of three 16x16 frames, and the third frame is a lie in nine
-- of them -- all zeroes in the compressed sheet, overwritten at load time
-- with one shared "open halves" blob for every ball but DIVE, LUXURY and
-- PREMIER.  Every timing is the cartridge's: a 34-frame throw with a
-- 40-pixel sine hump, a 28-frame absorb that shrinks the Pokemon to a fifth
-- while its palette blends to the BALL'S OWN colour, four bounces of 16, 13,
-- 11 and 10 frames with a sound each, and 59-frame shakes 31 frames apart.
-- v185: THE SECRET BASE'S DOOR OUT, AND THE PC IN THE ROOM.
--
-- "after making a secret base when i try and exit it puts me right back in
-- the secret base room" / "the pc in the secret base room doesnt work".  Two
-- faults, and the first hid nothing while the second hid everything.
--
-- The exit was an ALIAS: specials 8 and 24 were the same function here, and
-- 8's first act is to record where you are standing as the way back out.  8
-- runs outside on the route and 24 runs INSIDE, after 8 has already put you
-- in the room -- so the alias recorded the base room as the way out of the
-- base room.  The cartridge's 24 never touches the dynamic warp at all; it
-- warps to two coordinate bytes on the room's own table row, which 8 never
-- reads.  gen3SecretBases.rooms gained those, checked against each room's own
-- size because the twenty-four are not one shape.
--
-- The PC is a METATILE.  Not an object, not a bg event -- behaviour $B0 for
-- your own base and $B1 for someone else's, answered by
-- GetInteractedMetatileScript with a script address, so no walk over a map's
-- events was ever going to find one.  gen3SecretBases gained `pc`, read out
-- of that function's two arms: the predicate each calls, the behaviour that
-- predicate compares, and the script it answers.
--
-- ...and its DECORATION row now has something behind it.  gen3Decorations
-- gained the ten shapes (1x1 through 3x3, plus a 4x2 and a 2x4, read off the
-- jump table in ShowDecorationOnMap because they are not a table anywhere),
-- each record's metatile list -- stored 512 low, because they are offsets
-- into the secondary tileset -- the object-event graphics id that the
-- forty-five DOLLs and CUSHIONs carry INSTEAD of metatiles, the permission
-- that says which ones you may stand on, and the menu's own four rows.
-- v186: THE ROTATING GATES, FOUR YEARS LATE.
--
-- v172 read them and nothing ever looked at the record: nineteen gates, eight
-- shapes, their arm tables, four rotation grids and two sweep tables, sitting
-- in the cache unread while Fortree Gym stayed an empty hall.  That is this
-- port's dominant Gen 3 bug -- not "extracted wrong" but "extracted correctly
-- and read by nothing" -- and the fix is a reader, plus three things the
-- record was still missing.
--
-- WHERE THE COLOURS COME FROM.  Both sprite templates carry paletteTag $FFFF,
-- which reads as "it borrows the player's" and is wrong; their OAM names OBJ
-- palette SLOT 2, and the overworld fills its slots from a fixed tag table
-- shipped four times over.  All four copies say slot 2 is tag $1103, that tag
-- is the first NPC palette, and its entries 11, 12, 13 and 15 -- the only
-- four the eight sheets touch -- are an olive ramp and a black outline.  A
-- bamboo lattice, which is what a gate is.  The record gained the palette and
-- one baked 64-square strip.
--
-- AND A BLANK IS NOW A BLANK.  The four rotation grids were written with
-- `(v == NONE) and false or v` -- the oldest trap in Lua, since `true and
-- false` is false and `false or v` is v -- so all forty-eight blanks came out
-- as the byte $FF and the intended `false` was never written once.  Nothing
-- read the record, so it broke nothing; the first reader would have taken
-- $FF for a rotation of 15 into arm 15.  They are now decoded pairs, and the
-- two sweep tables are keyed by the rotation NUMBER that selects them rather
-- than by a name this port made up.
-- v187: THE ONE THAT WON'T STAND STILL.
--
-- Beat the league and the television names a Pokemon seen over Hoenn.  The
-- special that puts it in the air had no handler, and src/world/RoamMons.lua
-- is Crystal's three-beast byte roll keyed by names a Hoenn save has none of
-- -- so the whole system was a legendary the game announces and that is
-- nowhere in the region.  constants gained gen3Roamers, and two of its
-- numbers are the kind that look plausible while being wrong: the second
-- species is written `mov #204 / lsl #1`, so reading the immediate gives a
-- completely different Pokemon; and both sets of odds are masks over a Random
-- shifted left sixteen, so reading the immediates gives 240 and 192 rather
-- than one in sixteen and one in four.  Twenty places with fifty ways between
-- them, every one checked to be a real map and every way out to lead to
-- another of the twenty.
-- v188: THE CABLE CAR, which is the one way up Mt. Chimney.
--
-- Both stations run the same three rows -- `setvar $8004, <which> / special
-- 154 / special 155 / waitstate` -- and neither special had a handler, so
-- walking into the car incremented a game statistic and left the player
-- standing on the platform.  Where it goes is five immediates in one
-- function and no table at all: the special branches on VAR_0x8004 and calls
-- SetWarpDestination with a group, a map, a warp id of -1 and a cell in each
-- arm.  constants gained gen3CableCar, refused unless the two arms agree on
-- everything but the map number -- one group, one cell, one platform at each
-- end.
-- v189: THE HEALTHBOX, MEASURED.
--
-- "im also not nseeing the symbols for pokemons gender in blue or red in
-- battle next to their names and their names are looking a little too bold"
-- / "The exp bar is also overlapping the hp text".  Three faults and all
-- three were the layout guessing at numbers the panel already carries.
--
-- gen3BattleHud gained `geometry`, measured off each panel's own pixels: the
-- cream interior is the one index that fills a solid rectangle, and the EXP
-- strip is the row below it whose pixels alternate between two colours for
-- more than forty across.  The two panels are NOT the same shape -- the
-- foe's interior is nineteen tall and the player's twenty-seven, because the
-- player's box has a third row for the current-and-max numbers -- and one
-- height for both is what put those numbers eight pixels low, on the EXP
-- strip.  The strip is inside the panel too, not below it.
--
-- It also gained `text` and `gender`.  The healthbox renders into a window of
-- its own and names its three indices; the two gender symbols each override
-- the letter's colour in the STRING rather than in the call, so the index and
-- the glyph come out of the same four bytes -- 11 for a male and 10 for a
-- female, which in the healthbox palette are a light blue and a pink.  And
-- the two species whose own NAME ends in a symbol get none beside it.
-- v199: THE BACK OF A SHINY POKEMON.
--
-- Reported from play: "make sure shiny pokemon work".  In Hoenn they did not.
-- The importer had been decoding every species' FRONT sheet through
-- gMonShinyPaletteTable since v112 and writing it to spriteShiny, and nothing
-- in the engine ever read it, because every shiny test in the port asked for
-- `mon.dvs` -- which a Gen 3 Pokemon does not have.  With that fixed the
-- front pictures light up on their own, but the BACK sheet was still decoded
-- through the ordinary palette only: gMonShinyPaletteTable is one palette per
-- species and the cartridge applies it to whichever sheet is on screen, so
-- the player's own shiny Pokemon -- the one on screen for the whole battle --
-- came up in its ordinary colours from behind.
--
-- Every species row now also carries spriteShinyBack, and
-- assets/generated/battle/shiny_back/ gains its 386 pictures.  A cache built
-- before this has neither, so the file falls back to the ordinary back pic
-- rather than showing nothing -- but the fallback is the bug, which is why
-- this is a bump.
-- v200: THE HELD-ITEM ICON.
--
-- Reported from play: "in the pokemon party menu the hold item icon shows,
-- currently when theyre holding items it doesnt show anything like in the
-- rom".  sPartyMenuSpriteCoords has been read since the panels were, so every
-- slot's `item` x/y was already in gen3PartyMenu -- there was simply no
-- picture to put there.
--
-- It is not in the compressed party-graphics block with the ball and the
-- status pills, which is why a sweep of that block never turned it up: it is
-- sixty-four RAW bytes sitting in the middle of the sprite tables at 615E30,
-- named by the SpriteSheet at 615EB0 { 615E30, 0x40, tag 55120 } with its own
-- palette at 615E70.  Sixty-four bytes of 4bpp is two 8x8 tiles, and the
-- two-entry anim table at 615EA8 says what they are -- and the art proves the
-- reading on its own: frame 0 is a yellow-topped, red-bottomed parcel and
-- frame 1 a white envelope.
--
-- gen3PartyMenu.images gains `heldItem` (and `heldItemFrames`), and the
-- record gains `mail` -- the twelve item ids ItemIsMail (0D47BC, `cmp #132 /
-- bgt` then `cmp #121 / blt`) answers true for, kept as IDS so the screen
-- never sees a raw item number.
-- v201: A SHINY THAT STAYS SHINY WHILE IT MOVES.
--
-- Reported from play: "shiny pokemon during their emerald battle sprite
-- animation are turning to their normal non shiny colors and then after their
-- animation appear as their normal shiny colors".
--
-- Exactly that, and the cause is a seam the cartridge does not have.  Emerald
-- loads ONE palette for a battler and draws every frame of every sheet
-- through it; this port bakes the palette into each decoded PNG, so a species
-- needs one picture per palette per sheet.  v199 gave the front and back
-- STILLS their shiny decode -- and left the two-frame ANIMATION strip with
-- only the ordinary one, so a shiny lost its colours for precisely the frames
-- it was moving and got them back the moment it settled.
--
-- picAnim gains `shinySheet`, and assets/generated/battle/anim/shiny/ gains
-- its strips.  PicAnim.sheetFor is the one place that chooses between them.
-- v202: THE SEAFLOOR -- the diving suit, the blob, and the way back up.
--
-- Three reports, one dive.
--
-- "the surf sprite and character sprite that appears when diving isnt
-- appearing as well when underwater".  The underwater player is a whole
-- separate graphics row wearing its own palette -- 111 for the boy, 112 for
-- the girl -- seventy rows past the walking sheet, so the block walk that
-- finds the bicycle and the surfboard by palette could never reach it.  What
-- names it is sPlayerAvatarGfxIds, one { boy, girl } pair per avatar state;
-- the stage finds that table by the walking pair the manifest already names
-- and CHECKS it against the surfing pair the block derivation produced on its
-- own.  gen3PlayerSprites gains boyUnderwater / girlUnderwater.
--
-- "the underwater submarine room I cant use dive to go up here like im
-- supposed to be able to".  gen3Dive.noSurfacing was a STATISTIC taken over
-- the seven route/seafloor pairs, and it says nothing about the seven
-- underwater ROOMS, which have no surface map above them -- their ordinary
-- floor wears behaviours a route calls sealed, so the submarine room, the
-- Marine Cave and the Sealed Chamber's approach all refused to surface
-- anywhere.  MetatileBehavior_IsUnableToEmerge (0895D0) is four instructions
-- over two constants -- $19 and $2A -- and the stage now reads it, keeping
-- the statistic as a cross-check in the log.  (The same pass corroborates
-- the DIVE side: MetatileBehavior_IsDiveable is $11/$12/$14, exactly what the
-- old statistic had already produced.)
--
-- The third, the surf blob sitting eight pixels too high, needed no new data
-- -- see Player:drawSurfBlob.
--
-- v225: THE MAUVILLE OLD MAN.  The house east of the gym holds one of five
-- men, chosen from the trainer id, and every arm of it hung off a special
-- with no handler -- so the dispatcher branched on a stale VAR_RESULT and the
-- man in it said nothing.  extractMauvilleMan derives his block inside
-- SaveBlock1 off TraderDoDecorationTrade (and proves it: the four
-- eleven-byte name slots end exactly where the already-traded byte begins),
-- his four starting decorations and their previous owners off TraderSetup
-- (two tables that are adjacent in the ROM, so finding one finds the other),
-- and the sprite variable his map object reads out of gSpecials[107].  The
-- same stage finally answers a question this port had left open: the eight
-- decoration arrays in SaveBlock1, off SetDecorationInventoriesPointers --
-- ten desks, thirty ornaments, forty dolls -- which TILE to 150 slots with
-- no gap, and which `Gen3Decorations.roomFor` had been saying yes to
-- everything for want of.  constants gain gen3MauvilleMan and
-- gen3Decorations.capacity; the save layout gains mauvilleMan and
-- decorations.
--
-- ...and LILYCOVE'S LIFT, off the same tracer.  The department store's panel
-- asked two questions nothing answered: which row to open the cursor on (433)
-- and how long the ride is (276).  Zero is a valid answer to the first and it
-- means the TOP floor, so the lift offered 5F from the ground floor every
-- time.  extractElevator reads the map group and the run of map numbers off
-- the panel's own switch, checks the two bytes it reads sit a whole number of
-- eight-byte warp records past the saved location, traces each arm for the
-- row it answers -- they run backwards, top floor first -- and reads the
-- shake table, whose length ENDS ITSELF (the counts climb and the next byte
-- drops) and is the same number the ride clamps a long trip to.  constants
-- gain gen3Elevator.
--
-- v227: THE BATTLE HUD CARD.  Reported from play: "the EXP icon is not lined
-- up and the 12/12 HP text sits outside the card".  Two separate faults, both
-- off-by-a-few-pixels and both now read rather than placed.  The EXP one: the
-- import measures the dotted GROOVE in the panel art (two rows) and the ramp
-- FRAME that draws over it is a whole 8x8 tile with three rows of the box's
-- own edge above the bar, so laying the tile's top on the groove put the bar
-- three rows under it -- extractBattleHud now reads that offset off the empty
-- frame and proves it by the frame's bar being exactly as many rows as the
-- groove.  gen3BattleHud.bars gains expTop and expHeight.  (The other fault
-- needed no data: Font.glyphHeight was reading the DEFAULT page while the
-- healthbox had the small face pushed, so a box laid out for eleven-pixel
-- rows was being measured in fifteens.)
--
-- v228: THE SCROLLING MULTICHOICE.  `multichoice` draws a fixed list out of a
-- table this already read; the OTHER one -- a list too long for the screen --
-- is a special, and it was unserved, so thirteen counters in Hoenn branched
-- on whatever the last unrelated script had left in VAR_RESULT.  TWO OF THEM
-- ARE SHOPS no mart audit could find, because they are not `pokemart` lists:
-- Lavaridge's herb shop and Fallarbor's glass workshop.  extractScrollMulti-
-- choice reads the thirteen lists out of one flat run the task indexes as
-- `base + id * 64 + row * 4`, and what identifies it is that each of the
-- thirteen ARMS separately writes how many rows its own list has -- two
-- numbers found by two routes, agreeing thirteen times.  readText also gained
-- a `spacers` argument, because the cartridge lays a price out with CLEAR_TO
-- and dropping it reads as "PROTEIN1,000".  constants gain
-- gen3ScrollMultichoice.
--
-- v229: WHICH SLOT LINE PAID.  Reported from play: "when winning the slots it
-- should show where you lined them up to win" -- the machine could say how
-- much it had paid and not why, and on a three-coin spin that is five lines
-- it could have been.  The answer is already in the cartridge's art: the five
-- paylines are drawn into the machine's own tilemap, in the gaps between the
-- reel windows and outside the outer two, and the colour of each is its
-- PRICE -- blue for the coin that buys the middle row, yellow for the one
-- that buys the top and the bottom, red for the one that buys the diagonals,
-- the same three colours as the 3 / 2 / 1 / 2 / 3 lamps down either side.
-- extractSlotMachine now finds the three reel windows (the only holes the
-- backdrop leaves, because the reels are sprites) and reads a marker at each
-- row's centre and at each midpoint between two centres, and it CLOSES: five
-- samples come back as exactly three colours, the outer rows agreeing with
-- each other, the diagonals with each other, and the middle row with
-- neither.  gen3Slots gains `screen`.
--
-- v230: BEATING THE GAME.  The champion's room ends `setrespawn /
-- fadescreenspeed / special 275 / waitstate`, and 275 is GameClear -- it was
-- unserved, so beating the league changed nothing that lasts.  Its first two
-- acts are what the rest of Hoenn waits on: HealPlayerParty, then FlagSet on
-- the game-clear flag -- and this port READ that flag in two places and wrote
-- it in none, so a finished playthrough stayed permanently unfinished.  The
-- flag is derived as the one script-flag-sized word in gSpecials[275]'s own
-- literal pool, and it CLOSES: the PC's multichoice had already found the
-- same number by a completely different route, as the gate on its HALL OF
-- FAME row.  constants gain gen3GameClear.
local CACHE_FORMAT = "rom-cache-v268:"
-- Ruby/Sapphire Game3 IR (pair atlases, map pack, mp2k.bin) is a different

-- let a half-empty RS import look ready, or force Emerald through the RS
-- required-file list.

-- AND WHAT THAT IMPORT COULD NOT PRODUCE.
--
-- THE RE-IMPORT LOOP THIS ENDS. `isReady` demands the marker AND every
-- required file AND a plausible tileset registry, and the launcher re-imports
-- whenever it says no. That is right for a cache built before a file was
-- added: the next import writes it and the loop ends after one pass. It is
-- catastrophic for a file the version's extractor CANNOT write -- a romhack
-- whose title art, town map or player back-pic lives somewhere Gen 2's
-- symbols do not name. Then `isReady` is false forever, every launch re-runs a
-- three-minute extraction, and no amount of re-importing can clear it. Crystal
-- had exactly this (see the note on VERSION_REQUIRED_FILES) and it was fixed
-- by moving one filename; Prism hit it again, which is the sign the shape of
-- the check is wrong rather than any one list.
--
-- SO A FINISHED IMPORT RECORDS WHAT IT DID NOT PRODUCE, and those files stop
-- counting as a reason to run it again. The claim is narrow and true: this
-- exact cache format, against this exact ROM, has already been extracted once
-- and did not produce these -- so extracting again will not either. Any real
-- staleness still re-imports, because the marker line itself no longer matches
-- after a CACHE_FORMAT bump or a swapped ROM, and a gap list from an older
-- format is thrown away with it.
--
-- The marker stays a plain text file whose FIRST line is what it always was,
-- so an older build reading a newer marker sees a mismatch and re-imports,
-- which is the safe direction to be wrong in.

-- the Gen 1 branch for a Gen 3 game, and this was one of them.  Non-version
-- tabs like "mods" have no entry and answer generation 1, so they keep the
-- Gen1 art, and the next version added is right by default.
--
-- A NAMED RULE RATHER THAN A LINE INSIDE `draw`, because it decides three
-- things that have to agree -- the wordmark, the footer badge and whether
-- that badge is inverted (only the Boi's Club mark is dark ink; the UD badge
-- is already bright art) -- and because a rule that has now been widened
-- twice is one a test should be able to ask directly.

--
--   iOS     the document picker is an in-process modal sheet, so there is no
--           love.focus(true) when it dismisses -- nothing else would consume it.
--   Android the SAF picker IS a separate activity and normally does refocus,
--           but Android may destroy GameActivity while it is up, in which case
--           the app restarts and that focus event never comes.  Polling makes
--           the outcome the same either way instead of leaving the pick on disk
--           for the next tap to find, which is what made users import twice and
--           what made it look random: it depends on memory pressure (#553).
--
-- Deliberately NO timeout.  A version of this disarmed the poll after 120s so a
-- cancelled picker would stop scanning, which was wrong on iOS: the picker there
-- is an in-process modal sheet, so update() keeps running while it is open and
-- the window burned down while the player was still browsing Files.  The pick
-- then landed with nothing armed to consume it, and because every path here is
-- silent on success the import just did not happen, with no error shown.  A
-- half-second directory listing on a menu screen is far cheaper than an import
-- that vanishes, so the poll stays armed until something is actually consumed.
