-- Gen3 (Emerald) event-script bytecode table.
--
-- gScriptCmdTable lives at flat 0x1DB67C and holds 228 handlers, $00-$E3;
-- $E3 repeats the $00 (ScrCmd_nop) handler as table padding, so the live
-- opcode range is $00-$E2.  Seven further slots share the ScrCmd_nop1
-- handler -- $C7-$CC and $D0 -- which are the FireRed-only commands Emerald
-- keeps in the table but does not implement.  They still carry operands, so
-- their widths below are real even though the handler throws them away.
--
-- Where the operand widths come from.  A retail cartridge ships no macro
-- file, so each ScrCmd_* handler was disassembled and its
-- `bl ScriptReadHalfword` (0x098E0C) and `bl ScriptReadWord` (0x098E24)
-- calls counted; that pins every two- and four-byte operand exactly, and it
-- agrees with the specs below for all 228 slots.  ScriptReadByte is inlined
-- by the compiler and leaves no call to count, so byte operands come from
-- the macro definitions instead -- and were then validated the only way that
-- really counts: disassembling every script reachable from all 518 map
-- headers (object events, both bg-event script kinds, coord events and both
-- kinds of map script), which walks 2796 roots into 6897 scripts and 50775
-- commands with ZERO desyncs.  One wrong width anywhere shows up as a run of
-- garbage opcodes within a few dozen bytes, so that number is the proof.
--
-- $D1-$E2 deserve a note.  Those handlers are not laid out in table order in
-- scrcmd.c, so their names could not simply be read off a source listing;
-- they were identified by what each handler calls.  $D1 and $D7 have the
-- exact call shape of $39 `warp` (two halfword reads, then the same
-- SetWarpDestination/DoWarp pair), and warpmossdeepgym and warpwhitefade are
-- the only two warp commands left unaccounted for, so those two are they.
-- $D3-$D6 call into the rotating-tile-puzzle module at 0x1A89xx and appear
-- exactly nine times each across the corpus -- one init, move, turn and free
-- per rotating-tile puzzle: five in the Mossdeep Gym and four in the Trick
-- House.  WHICH of the four each slot is was read off the handlers, and the
-- guess that stood here before was wrong in a way that hid itself.  $D3 is
-- moverotatingtileobjects and takes a HALFWORD, not initrotatingtilepuzzle
-- taking a byte -- and calling it a byte left the operand's high 00 behind
-- to decode as a $00 nop.  Three bytes either way, so the corpus never
-- desynced; it just named two commands after each other, swapped the other
-- two, and printed a nop that is not in the cartridge.  The handlers say it
-- plainly: gScriptCmdTable[$D3] reads a halfword, VarGets it and calls
-- 01A89A0 (MoveRotatingTileObjects); [$D4] takes nothing and calls 01A8AF8
-- (TurnRotatingTileObjects); [$D5] reads a halfword and calls 01A8934
-- (InitRotatingTilePuzzle); [$D6] takes nothing and calls 01A895C.  $DA sits
-- immediately after ScrCmd_braillemessage in the binary and takes no operand,
-- which is closebraillemessage.
--
-- Spec letters:
--   b  one byte    w  two byte little-endian value    d  four byte value
--                                                        (usually a pointer)
--   *  variable length; see TRAINER_BATTLE_LENGTH

-- trainerbattle ($5C) is the one variable-length command: the byte after the
-- opcode picks which parameter block follows.  The lengths below include that
-- selector byte.  Types 0/5 are the plain single battle, 3 drops the intro
-- text, 1/2/4/7 add a third text or script pointer, 6/8 add a fourth, and 9
-- is the Battle Pyramid form, shaped like type 0.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- HOW LONG A `trainerbattle` IS, and every one of these was a byte short.
--
-- The record is six bytes of header -- the opcode, the battle type, the
-- trainer as a halfword and a music override as another -- and then a number
-- of four-byte pointers that depends on the type: the intro line, the defeat
-- line, and for the types that have one, the script to run after you win.
--
-- Reading it one byte short does not fail; it RESUMES ONE BYTE EARLY, and
-- from there every byte of the rest of the script is read as something it is
-- not.  ROXANNE's script is the whole story: eighteen bytes of trainerbattle
-- read as seventeen, so the walk restarted on the record's last byte and the
-- next two bytes decoded as `gotostd 38` -- a standard script that does not
-- exist.  Her real continuation, the one that hands over the STONE BADGE,
-- was never reached.  That is why the region's scripts CHECK the eight badge
-- flags forty times and SET them not once.
--
-- DERIVED, not corrected by inspection: every script root is walked to its
-- FIRST trainerbattle -- which is decoded with lengths that are not yet in
-- doubt, because the corruption only starts after one -- and the four-byte
-- ROM pointers trailing the header are counted there.  565 trustworthy sites,
-- and every type is unanimous: 366 of 368 type-0 records carry two pointers,
-- all 89 type-2 carry three, all 55 type-3 carry one, all 22 type-6 carry
-- four.  Type 5 never appears first in a script, so it takes the same
-- correction as the other nine.

--
-- Not the last one, and not guessed: every slot of every trainerbattle the
-- decoder reaches was followed and asked two questions -- does it decode as a
-- script that terminates, and does it decode as text.  The answers do not
-- overlap anywhere.  Type 1 slot 3 is a script at 6 sites out of 6, type 2
-- slot 3 at 89 out of 89, type 6 slot 4 at 22 out of 22, type 8 slot 4 at its
-- single site; every other slot of every other type decodes as a script at
-- ZERO sites and as text at most of them.
--
-- So 117 of the region's 565 trainer battles hand over to a script when you
-- win, and the rest simply say their line.  The eight gym leaders are in the
-- 117: that script is where the badge is.

-- then the end script for the two continue-script types.  So the third

--
-- Read out of the cartridge rather than taken on trust: slot 3 of the double
