-- that machine the player and NPCs carry a fixed object color instead of
-- tinting with whatever region palette their feet stand over.  An EARLIER
-- attempt at per-sprite color baked GBC_BG (the RED background ramp) onto
-- characters -- that was the "reds coloring on the player/NPCs" bug; the object
-- palette is GBC_OBJ (green), so baking that here is the fix, not that
-- regression.  Terrain is unaffected -- pal() below still hands SGB its per-map
-- BG palette; only OG RED short-circuits BG to the one global red palette.
--
-- OG YELLOW does NOT.  Yellow ships CGB code and colors regions via
-- CGBBasePalettes the same way SGB mode colors SuperPalettes, so sprites tint
-- with the map zone (usesSpriteObp stays off).
--
-- SGB does NOT.  The Super Game Boy colorizes the composited DMG picture it is
-- handed and cannot tell an OBJ pixel from a BG one; pokered never sends the
-- OBJ_TRN packet that would enable SGB sprite mode (data/sgb/sgb_packets.asm
-- defines ATTR_BLK / PAL_SET / PAL_TRN / MLT_REQ / CHR_TRN / PCT_TRN and
-- nothing else), so a character there wears the very palette its map does.
-- Baking GBC_OBJ over it was issue #301 ("people in SGB mode are green": the
-- boot-ROM greens sat on top of ROUTE's own greens and blues).  What issue
-- #150 actually caught was the missing rOBP0 step, not a missing object
-- palette: overworld OBJs run through OBP0 = $D0 (home/fade.asm FadePal4
-- `dc 3,1,0,0`), which lifts OBJ color 1 to DMG shade 0 and color 2 to shade 1,
-- so Red's cap lands on the ROUTE palette's shade-1 GRASS GREEN and blends into
-- the grass exactly as #150's reference shot shows.  Drawn with an identity
-- shade map it landed on shade 2 = light-blue instead, which is the clash #150
-- reported.  SpriteRenderer bakes that OBP0 ramp (PaletteFX.dmgObj) and lets
-- the zone shader color the result.  RED++ colors sprites through the
-- usesGbcPack() path in SpriteRenderer instead.
-- Does COLORS currently mean "show me the real hardware colour"?
--
-- Gen2 sheets carry their own CGB OBJ palette (MapObjectPals), and the
-- overworld used to apply it unconditionally -- which made COLORS a no-op out
-- in the world while battle still honoured it.  Gating it here lets the
-- setting mean the same thing everywhere: the two hardware-colour modes wear
-- the ROM's palettes, and the DMG/SGB-flavoured modes fall through to the
-- shade treatment they describe.
-- The four DMG/SGB novelty modes below are shade treatments; everything else
-- means "show me the real colour".  Listing the novelties rather than the
-- hardware modes matters: `gbc` (labelled SGB) is the DEFAULT, and gating it
-- out sent a freshly imported Gen2 game down the shade-remap path -- garish
-- green and cyan terrain with every NPC a black silhouette, because a Gen2
