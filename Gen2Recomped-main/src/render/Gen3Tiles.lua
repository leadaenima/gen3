-- Gen3 metatile compositing.
--
-- A Gen 1 or Gen 2 block is 4x4 tiles out of one tileset with one palette map
-- and no flipping, so the renderer can bake a single atlas once and blit 8x8
-- quads out of it.  A Gen 3 metatile is none of those things:
--
--   * it is 16x16 -- 2x2 tiles, not 4x4 -- so a metatile is the engine's CELL,
--     not its block;
--   * it has TWO LAYERS of those 2x2 tiles, and the player walks between them,
--     which is what puts a sprite behind a treetop;
--   * every one of the eight tile entries carries its own PALETTE and its own
--     horizontal and vertical flip;
--   * and it draws out of TWO tilesets at once -- the map's primary and its
--     secondary -- with a separate bank boundary for tiles, for metatiles and
--     for palettes.
--
-- Those three boundaries are the trap.  They are plain constants with nothing
-- in the cartridge header to announce them, and the palette one fails
-- silently: palette slot 6 read out of the primary bank is sixteen zero words,
-- so a wrong boundary renders every wall in Littleroot solid black while the
-- roofs directly above them stay perfect.  tools/gen3_discover.py derives all
-- three from the cartridge -- a primary tileset is by definition the one whose
-- metatiles never reach into the other bank, and 14 secondaries independently
-- begin their palettes at exactly slot 6 -- and this module reads them from
-- the manifest rather than restating them.
--
-- Index 0 is transparent on BOTH layers.  What shows through is the backdrop,
-- which is palette 0 colour 0.

-- Sheet baking
--

-- out of them.  Two sheets rather than one flattened image is the whole point:
-- the player walks BETWEEN them, which is what puts a character behind a
-- treetop and in front of the grass under it.
--
-- Baking is deferred and cached per pair because it is the expensive part
-- (a 656-metatile pair is about 336,000 pixels across the two sheets) and
-- because 441 layouts share only 76 pairs.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- long or the secondary's metatiles have nowhere to sit.
--

-- EIGHT. Every room in the game asks for ids 513 and up, the sheet was 204
-- metatiles long, every lookup past 203 came back nil, and the inside of the
-- house was white while the town outside it was not.

-- loop iterations and no pixels: `entries` returns nothing for an id its bank
-- never defined, so nothing is plotted and the sheet rows stay transparent.

-- caller supplies the surface, so this is the same code path the headless
-- tests exercise and the one that fills a love ImageData.
-- WHICH SIDE OF THE PLAYER A METATILE'S TOP HALF IS ON.
--
-- Not every metatile's second layer is scenery to walk behind. The
-- attributes word carries a layer type, and it decides which background the
-- top half is drawn to -- which is to say whether the player passes in front
-- of it or behind it.
--
-- The cartridge answers this with its own map data, on the first map of the
-- game. In Littleroot:
--
--   * the cell directly in front of EVERY door -- metatile 513, the one you
--     stand on the moment you step out of a house -- is layer type 1, and it
--     has 138 of its 256 pixels in the TOP layer. Drawn above the player,
--     that buries him to the chest every time he leaves a building.
--   * every tree and roof cell -- 528, 529, 530, up to 256 pixels of top
--     layer, all of them impassable -- is layer type 0. Those are precisely
--     the things you walk behind.
--
-- So type 1's top half is a second layer of GROUND (a carpet over a floor, a
-- path over grass) and belongs under the sprites; type 0's is cover and
-- belongs over them. Type 2 is rare -- 392 cells in the whole game, 98% of
-- them with a top layer and 85% walkable -- and behaves like type 0: it is
-- the tall grass you stand IN, whose blades draw across your feet.
--
-- Baking everything above the sprites, which is what this did, put a
-- character under the floor he was standing on 29% of the time.

-- WHICH HALF OF A METATILE COVERS A REFLECTION, which is not the same

--
-- The hardware has THREE background layers under a Gen 3 map, and a
-- metatile's layer type says which two of them it uses
-- (METATILE_LAYER_TYPE_*, read out of bits 12-15 of the attributes word):
--
--   NORMAL  (0)  middle + top
--   COVERED (1)  bottom + middle
--   SPLIT   (2)  bottom + top
--
-- A character is an object at priority 2, which on this hardware draws above
-- the bottom and middle backgrounds and below the top one -- so the top layer
-- is the half that hides them, which is what topIsAbovePlayer answers and
-- what drawAbove draws.
--
-- A REFLECTION is an object at priority 3 (SetUpReflection, ROM:0153EE8,
-- `mov r3,#152` subpriority and the priority field beside it).  Priority 3
-- draws above the BOTTOM background ONLY: every other layer of the metatile
-- it lands in covers it.  So:

--            planks in layer 2, and that is how the cartridge puts a
--            reflection in the water UNDER a pier instead of on top of it.
