-- ------- window style
--
-- A Game Boy window is white paper with black text on it, and for a screen
-- that IS the Game Boy that is the end of the matter.  It stops being the end
-- of the matter the moment something is drawn BEHIND the window: a battle
-- fought on the live 3D map has a world where the flat white field used to
-- be, and an opaque box sitting on top of it is a hole in the picture.
--
-- So a caller can push a style for a region of drawing:
--
--     Font.pushStyle({ fill = { 1, 1, 1, 0.4 }, text = { 1, 1, 1, 1 } })
--     Font.drawBox(0, 12, 20, 6)
--     Font.draw("...", 8, 112)
--     Font.popStyle()
--
-- `fill` replaces the box's paper colour and `text` repaints the glyphs --
-- repaints, not tints: the atlas is black pixels on a transparent field, so
-- setColor alone can only ever darken it.  That is what Font.beginTint is
-- for, and drawCode reaches for it itself here rather than making every
-- caller remember, because the callers are `Font.draw` loops scattered
-- through the battle screen and half of them set black explicitly on the way
-- past.  `border` styles the frame glyphs separately when it is given, and
-- falls back to `text` when it is not.
--
-- A STACK rather than a single value: one screen draws several windows and
-- only some of them want this (the move list keeps its solid paper while the
-- dialogue underneath goes to glass), so a region has to be able to turn the
-- style OFF and get it back.  `pushStyle(nil)` is that -- it pushes "no
-- style", which is exactly what an unstyled region wants and is why the
-- argument is allowed to be nil rather than rejected.

-- 8 for a Game Boy cache, because a Game Boy character is one tile.  Emerald's
-- dialogue face is FIFTEEN, and every piece of layout in this engine was
-- written against the 8 -- which is why the save panel's second line ran
-- through the bottom of its own window the moment the right face was loaded.
-- A layout that asks for this instead of assuming lays out correctly for both.
-- HOW TALL ONE LINE IS -- IN THE FACE THAT IS ACTUALLY IN FORCE.
--
-- This read state.order[1], the default page, and ignored the face stack
-- entirely.  Font.width does not: it measures through pageFor, which asks the
-- pushed face first.  So a screen that pushed a face got its WIDTHS from that
-- face and its HEIGHT from the dialogue one, and every layout that stacks
-- rows by glyph height was laying them out for a taller line than it drew.
--
-- The battle healthbox is the worst of them, because its arithmetic is exact.
-- The cartridge sets a healthbox in FONT_SMALL, eleven pixels tall, and the
-- foe's cream interior is nineteen: eleven plus the bar's eight is exactly
-- that, and the player's twenty-seven takes a third row of eleven with the
-- three that do not fit coming out of descender space.  Answering fifteen --
-- the dialogue face -- turned that three-pixel lift into eleven and pulled
-- the HP bar up into the name.
