-- PLAIN PROSE -> THE MARKED-UP TEXT THE CARTRIDGE WOULD HAVE HAD.

-- Cartridge text arrives carrying its own layout: `\n` starts the second
-- line, `\f` ends a page and waits for A. Text an author typed in the map
-- editor carries none of that -- it is a sentence -- so `paginate` wrapped it
-- to the box width and put every one of the resulting lines on a SINGLE page.
-- A page with ten lines does not wait; it scrolls them past and closes. The
-- report was "the text box just runs to the end without me pressing A", which
-- is exactly that.
--
-- So the layout is put back. The wrapping is `paginate`'s own -- called here
-- rather than reimplemented, because it measures in PIXELS against the font
-- actually loaded (a mod's variable-advance font wraps differently) and a
-- second copy that counted characters would disagree with the box it is
-- wrapping for.
--
-- TWO LINES A PAGE, which is what the window shows. Not three with a scroll:
-- the ROM's own authored text is written two lines at a time, and a box that
-- scrolled a line away before the reader pressed anything is the bug being
-- fixed, not a smaller version of it.
--
-- THE AUTHOR'S OWN BREAKS ARE KEPT. A blank line between paragraphs becomes a
-- page break, and a single newline starts a new line -- so someone who laid
-- their dialogue out deliberately gets what they laid out, and someone who
-- typed one long sentence gets it wrapped for them.

  -- BLANK line ends the page, which is how anyone lays out dialogue without
  -- being taught a markup.
  --
  -- The alternative -- reflowing everything into one paragraph -- was the
  -- first cut, and it silently discarded a layout the author had chosen. Being
  -- friendlier to someone who typed one long line is not worth overriding

-- The UI canvas is the Game Boy's 160x144 unless a state on the stack asks
-- for more, and the text box never did -- it had no reason to while every
-- box in the port was Red's twenty tiles.  Emerald's is twenty-eight, and a
-- 224-pixel box on a 160-pixel canvas is drawn off the right-hand edge and
-- blitted at the canvas's own scale, which is not the world's: the box came
-- out larger than the map behind it AND cut off.
--
-- Asking is all that is needed -- Game:draw already reallocates the canvas
-- for whichever state on the stack wants a native surface, and centres the
-- Game Boy-coordinate layouts inside it.  A box that fits the classic screen
-- asks for the classic screen, so nothing about Gen 1 or Gen 2 changes.
-- Theme owns the answer, and the FIELD gives the same one -- see
-- OverworldState:uiSize.  Asking here alone made the whole screen step down a
-- scale every time a box opened, because the fit scale follows the surface.
