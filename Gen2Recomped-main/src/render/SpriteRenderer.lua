-- flat color per map (different tiles can have very different color-0s),
-- so shade 0 is keyed to alpha 0 here explicitly -- matching real GBC OBJ
-- hardware, where sprite palette index 0 is unconditionally transparent
-- (same rule TileRenderer's getColor0KeyShader documents for tall grass).

-- reflections like they do in the emerald rom".
--
-- A Gen 3 reflection is not an effect over the tiles -- it is a SECOND SPRITE
-- of the same object, vertically flipped, drawn below it on the water line,
-- and the cartridge decides three things about it:
--
--   * WHETHER, from the metatile behaviour under the object's feet.  That set
--     is derived at import (see extractReflections) and is the caller's
--     business, not this file's.
--   * WHICH PICTURE.  The same frame the character is showing this instant --
--     which is why this copies the quad the last :draw chose rather than
--     working one out again.  A reflection that picked its own frame would be
--     a different person in the water.
--   * WHICH COLOURS.  The graphics row's reflectionPaletteTag when it names
--     one -- 25 of Emerald's 246 rows do, all of them the player's own
--     avatars -- and the sprite's OWN palette when it does not, which is what
--     LoadObjectRegularReflectionPalette does for everybody else.  The import
--     composes the recoloured sheet for the 25 and names it on the def; this
--     just uses it when it is there.
--
-- DRAWN FROM THE FEET DOWN.  The water line is the bottom of the cell the
-- character stands in, so the reflection occupies the cell below it, and the
-- two touch. `sy = -1` with the origin at the far edge is what mirrors it.
-- WHICH FRAME THE CHARACTER IS SHOWING, AND WHICH WAY ROUND.
--
-- Pulled out of :draw so the REFLECTION can ask the same question without
-- having to be drawn after the sprite.  It used to copy the quad the last
-- :draw chose, which forced the reflection to come second -- and that put it
-- on the wrong side of the map's top layer for anyone standing on a bridge,
-- where the whole point is that the deck covers the reflection and not the

-- ---- THE SWAY, AND WHAT IS AND IS NOT DERIVED ABOUT IT -------------------
--
-- Reported from play: "in the real game when reflections appear in the water
-- they sway and move, they arent perfect reflections like we have right now".
-- That is right, and this is the one thing in the reflection that this port
-- does NOT read off the cartridge.  What was established, so the next person
-- does not repeat it:
--
--   * A water reflection is an affine sprite.  SetUpReflection (ROM:0153ED4)
--     sets oam.affineMode = ST_OAM_AFFINE_NORMAL for the non-still case, and
--     water IS the non-still case -- the ground-effect flag table at
--     0850E5DC maps ice to bit 5 (still) and reflective to bit 4 (affine).
--   * UpdateObjectReflectionSprite (ROM:01540A8) forces oam.matrixNum to 0,
--     or 1 when the sprite is horizontally flipped.  So the sway can only be
--     OAM matrix 0 and 1 -- there is nowhere else for it to live.
--   * ResetOamMatrices (ROM:00071F8) fills all 32 matrices with a pure
--     identity, and the reflection's affine anim table is
--     gDummySpriteAffineAnimTable (082EC6A8, referenced 857 times), whose
--     only command is END -- so the sprite engine never writes one either.
--   * Every place the cartridge can write a matrix was checked: both
--     SetOamMatrix entry points (the 5-argument one at 0007224 with its 27
--     callers, and the pointer form at 0007DD4) and all 18 sites that
--     materialise the matrix array.  NONE targets matrix 0 or 1 from field
--     code; the constant-index callers are task-driven battle and contest
--     sprites.
--
-- Which leaves a contradiction I could not resolve -- an identity matrix
-- would not even flip the reflection, and it plainly is flipped -- so one
-- link is still missing and this is NOT that link.  It is a stand-in.
--
-- What it copies is the SHAPE the hardware can make, which is the honest part
-- of the guess: one affine matrix per sprite cannot ripple a reflection row
-- by row, it can only shear it -- x' = a*x + b*y -- so an animated `b` skews
-- the image, leaving the end nearest the feet still and the far end swinging
-- widest.  That is what this draws, and it rides the tileset animation clock
-- so it keeps time with the water it is lying on rather than free-running
-- against it.
