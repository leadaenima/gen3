-- Rendering pipelines: the engine side of the render_pipelines registry.
--
-- A pipeline is a display mode a mod owns.  It may replace the overworld's
-- world pass with geometry of its own (drawWorld) and/or post-process the
-- finished composite (present).  Everything else about being a display mode
-- -- the OFF/1/2/3 ladder, the options row, the hotkey, persistence, the
-- free-roam gate, and never letting a mod's error take the frame down -- is
-- engine plumbing and lives here, so a renderer mod writes the two draw
-- functions and declares the rest.
--
-- The two halves compose independently and in priority order: the highest
-- priority eligible drawWorld renders the world, then every eligible
-- present folds over whatever came out (the world pipeline's canvas, or the
-- vanilla flat/tilt composite when none ran).  A present that is switched
-- off returns its input, so a full ladder of them costs nothing at level 0.
--
-- Nothing here reaches collision, movement, triggers or scripts: like
-- survey zoom and tilt, a pipeline is purely presentational, which is why
-- its level rides in save.options rather than the save proper.

--     compound into a crash a second later, and the log names the pipeline
--     that did it.
