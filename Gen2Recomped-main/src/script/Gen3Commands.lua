-- Runtime commands for the Gen3 script VM.
--
-- Gen3ScriptVM lowers Emerald bytecode into ScriptRunner rows.  Most rows are
-- ordinary engine commands (show_text, set_flag, warp, ...); the ones with no
-- Gen1/Gen2 equivalent live here under a `g3_` prefix so they never collide
-- with the hand-ported vocabulary in data/scripts/ or with Gen2Commands.
--
-- THE COMPARISON REGISTER is the structural difference from Gen 2.  Emerald
-- does not branch on "the last command succeeded"; it keeps a result valued
-- 0, 1 or 2 -- less, equal, greater -- and every branch carries a condition
-- byte selecting a row of this table:
--
--            result:  0(<)  1(=)  2(>)
--     0  LT            yes    no    no
--     1  EQ             no   yes    no
--     2  GT             no    no   yes
--     3  LE            yes   yes    no
--     4  GE             no   yes   yes
--     5  NE            yes    no   yes
--
-- `checkflag` sets the register to the flag's own value, so `checkflag /
-- goto_if 1` reads "if the flag is set" and `goto_if 0` reads "if it is
-- clear" -- 0 is less than 1.  Collapsing the six conditions to a boolean
-- would invert about half the branches in Hoenn, which is the kind of wrong
-- that looks like scattered event bugs rather than a decoder fault.
--
-- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY INERT.  Several verbs below record their request and
-- do nothing else, because the engine has no Gen 3 equivalent yet (decorations,
-- secret bases, contests, the Battle Frontier).  That is a considered choice:
-- a script that skips a step degrades a scene, while a script that guesses at
-- one corrupts a save.  Every inert verb is named here rather than left out of
-- the lowering table, so `Gen3ScriptVM.lowered` reports honest coverage.

-- that a script fills.  Route 103's ON_TRANSITION opens with
-- `call Common_EventScript_SetupRivalGfxId`, and that is what decides whether
-- the child waiting for you is Brendan or May.
--
-- The port already refused to draw an object whose slot was unfilled -- and
-- rightly, because the placeholder art in those rows is a stranger.  What it
-- had was a reader with no writer: NOTHING in the engine ever put anything
-- into save.gen3ObjectSprites, so all 337 objects that name a slot were

--     memset(r0 + 0x139C, 0, 32)           the first THIRTY-TWO var bytes
--
-- Four bytes of flags is 32 flags -- $000-$01F -- and thirty-two bytes of
-- vars is SIXTEEN vars, $4000-$400F.  It is called from both map-load paths
-- (0x00850D8 and 0x00851C0), so every warp, every door and every connection

-- -- a map load that forgot who was standing where would empty Hoenn.  The

--
-- This used to answer "FLAG_G3_TRAINER_0109" -- a namespace of its own, which
-- was self-consistent and reached nothing.  Emerald has no separate trainer
-- namespace: a trainer's flag is an ORDINARY flag at TRAINER_FLAGS_START + id,
-- in the same bit array as every other flag, which is why the region's scripts
-- can leave the whole block alone and the battle setup can own it.
--
-- The cost of the private name was in the SAVE.  Gen3Save round-trips flags by
-- walking the bit array and spelling each one "FLAG_G3_%04X"; a key shaped any
-- other way is not in that walk.  So importing a real Emerald save dropped
-- every trainer the player had beaten -- all 855 of them re-challenged on
-- sight -- and exporting one wrote a save that had beaten nobody.
--
-- The base is the import's, derived and corroborated there (see

-- honest answer, so this says so rather than inventing one.

-- AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU WIN.
--
-- A trainerbattle record carries, for four of its ten types, a POINTER TO THE
-- SCRIPT THAT RUNS ON A WIN -- and the import used to read the record only
-- far enough to get the type and the trainer, so that pointer went in the
-- bin.  117 of Hoenn's 565 trainer battles have one, and the eight gym
-- leaders are among them: ROXANNE's whole visible script is a trainerbattle,
-- and everything that happens after you beat her -- the STONE BADGE, the TM,
-- the words -- lives behind that pointer.
--
-- That is why the region's scripts CHECK the eight badge flags forty times
-- and SET them not once, and why no HM in Hoenn could ever be used.
--
-- start_battle yields until the battle is over, so by the time it returns the
-- result is known and the continuation can simply run here -- which is what
-- TRAINER_BATTLE_CONTINUE_SCRIPT means: execution continues THERE.
-- WHICH MODES ASK "HAVE I ALREADY LOST TO YOU?"
--
-- `trainerbattle` does not test the flag itself.  What it does is RETURN a
-- script, and it is that script which tests it.  Nine of the twelve modes
-- return one of two scripts and both of them open the same way:
--
--   EventScript_TryDoNormalTrainerBattle  0827_1362  (modes 0,1,2,9,12)
--   EventScript_TryDoDoubleTrainerBattle  0827_138A  (modes 4,6,8)
--       lock / faceplayer / the "!" bubble
--       specialvar VAR_RESULT, $39      -- GetTrainerFlag: FlagGet($500+id)
--       compare VAR_RESULT, 0
--       goto_if NE  ->  gotopostbattlescript
--
-- Mode 3 -- the no-intro variant -- returns 0827_13C2, which has NO check:
-- it is used where the script has already decided to fight.  Modes 5 and 7
-- return the rematch scripts, which gate on rematch readiness (special $3D)
-- rather than on the beaten flag, so they are left alone here too.

  [6] = true, [8] = true, [9] = true, [12] = true,
}

-- ...AND THE ONE MODE THAT DOES NOT STOP WHEN YOU WIN.
--
-- Reported from play: "After battling may in the route below fortree city her
-- sprite stays there even though she drives away on her bike".  She does ride
-- away -- eleven commands after the battle -- and none of them ran.
--
-- There are TWO jumps out of a trainer battle and they do not go to the same
-- place.  `gotobeatenscript` ($5F) goes to the record's own continuation
-- pointer, and to `release / end` when the mode has none; `gotopostbattlescript`
-- ($5E) goes to the byte AFTER the record, which is the next command of the
-- script that ran the battle.  Modes 0, 1, 2 and the doubles end with the
-- first, which is why beating an ordinary trainer stops there and their line
-- waits for you to talk to them again.
--
-- MODE 3 ENDS WITH THE SECOND.  Its engine script is
--
--     0827_13C2  applymovement VAR_LAST_TALKED, reveal_trainer
--                waitmovement 0
--                special $3B

--                gotopostbattlescript     $5E     <-- the byte after the record
--
-- and its record is ten bytes with no continuation pointer at all -- the
-- resume address is the cursor past the record, which TrainerBattleLoadArgs
-- stores through parameter type 6.  So mode 3 is the mode a CUTSCENE uses:
-- the intro is already on screen, the battle happens in the middle of the
-- script, and the script carries on.  Treating it like the others ended the
-- rival's scene the instant she was beaten, leaving her standing on Route 119

-- into that (0B13EC) THE CURSOR AFTER THE WHOLE RECORD -- the very next
-- instruction of the trainer's own script.  So on a re-talk the cartridge
-- simply falls through to the line after the trainerbattle, which is the
-- msgbox every beaten trainer says.  In this port those rows are already
-- sitting in the same compiled list, so falling through IS the behaviour:
-- returning nothing lets the runner advance to them.
--
-- What was happening instead: nothing read the flag on the talk path at all
-- (the SIGHT path was gated, which is why only talking re-triggered), so
-- every trainer in Hoenn fought you again, forever, every time you spoke to
-- them.

-- and a badge on the other side of the second set.
--
-- The floor is painted with arrows and every arrow metatile says two things
-- at once: which BUTTON it answers to and which WAY it points, packed as
-- `base + puzzle * stride + direction`.  Press a button and everything
-- standing on one of that puzzle's arrows walks one tile the way its arrow
-- points; then each of them turns to face the way its NEW arrow points, and
-- that second half is what makes them read as being rotated by the floor
-- rather than walked across it.
--
-- Every number here -- the two bases, the stride, the direction order, the
-- eight movement scripts -- is derived in RomExtractorGen3:extractRotatingTiles
-- and arrives as data.constants.gen3RotatingTiles; nothing is written down
-- here.  The one thing this file knows on its own is what "right" means.
--
-- WHERE THE OBJECT IS, not where it looks like it is.  The cartridge moves
-- the object's TEMPLATE the moment the walk starts and reads the new arrow
-- back out of the template, so the turn is decided before the walk animation
-- has played a frame.  Reading the entity's live cell instead would make the
-- turn depend on whether `waitmovement 0` -- which waits on ONE of the walks
-- -- happened to be the last of them to land.  So the destination is recorded
-- here at the moment the walk is started, exactly as the cartridge does.
--
-- The walk scripts open and close with actions $94 and $95, which freeze and
-- release an object's idle animation while it slides.  This engine has no
-- idle-animation lock to freeze, so the movement reader passes them over --
-- which is the whole of the difference between the two.

-- WHICH EFFECT IDS ARE A FIELD MOVE, ALL OF THEM.
--
-- Reported from play: "for rock smash cut dive waterfall etc, make sure the
-- pokemon HM transitions are working for when you press a, currently surf
-- works but rock smash didnt".  Right: this used to read the ids off
-- gen3FieldMoveText, which the import writes for exactly THREE moves -- SURF,
-- WATERFALL and DIVE, the ones whose sentences it went looking for.  Every
-- other field move ran with no announcement because its number was not on a
-- list that was never meant to be the list.
--
-- WHAT THE LIST REALLY IS, and why it can be written down here.
--
-- gFieldEffectScriptPointers is indexed by a plain enum, and this port has
-- already derived SEVEN of its entries by seven separate routes that knew
-- nothing about each other:
--
--   0  the "!" bubble        \
--   33 the "?" bubble         >  found by reading three natives (see EMOTE)
--   46 the heart             /
--   5  the ripple               found by its own predicate and template
--   25 the Pokemon Centre heal  the one effect whose script also heals
--   9  SURF     \
--   43 WATERFALL >  found beside their sentences (fieldMoveMessages)
--   44 DIVE     /
--
-- All seven land exactly where that enum puts them.  Seven independent
-- agreements is not a coincidence -- it is the identification -- so the rest
-- of the enum is this cartridge's too, and the field-move rows can be named
-- from it.  ANCHORS below is that check, re-run against the loaded cache
-- every time: if a dataset disagrees about even one of the four it still
-- carries, nothing is claimed and the behaviour is what it was.

-- wait for it and the row after this one must not run until the player has
-- answered.
-- 470 and 508: THE SOOTOPOLIS CUTSCENE.
--
-- Reported from play: "Make sure the cutscene for groudon, kyogre and
-- rayquaza appears after going to the tower and making rayquaza flee and
-- returning to sootopolis".
--
-- HOW IT WAS IDENTIFIED, and it did not need the name list.  Sootopolis
-- City's ON_FRAME_TABLE has exactly two rows -- one gated on the city's own
-- state var, one on the var the Sky Pillar sets when Rayquaza flies off --
-- and both of their scripts were decoded command by command.  Every opcode in
-- them is lowered by the VM and every special they call is implemented,
-- except this one.  The scene fades out, sets gSpecialVar_0x8004, calls it,
-- and waits: everything the player is supposed to SEE in that gap is inside
-- the special.  A script that removes Kyogre and Groudon, adds Rayquaza, and
-- hands over to one call before crying Rayquaza's cry is not ambiguous about
-- what that call is.
--
-- gSpecials[470] and gSpecials[508] share a pointer -- the importer finds
-- that pair on its own evidence, knowing no names -- so both indices land
-- here.
--
-- 0x8004 IS WHICH HALF.  The cartridge's own Script_DoRayquazaScene reads it
-- and passes it straight through as the index the scene's step table starts
-- at, with the other argument saying whether the advance stops after the
-- first screen.  Sootopolis sets it to 0 before the Groudon and Kyogre scene
-- and 1 before Rayquaza's, and that is the whole of the difference.
--
-- BLOCKING, because the script's next command is `waitstate` and the
-- cartridge uses it to wait for exactly this.

-- 159: CHOOSE STARTER, and 0: HEAL PLAYER PARTY.
--
-- HOW THESE TWO WERE IDENTIFIED, because it is not the obvious way.  The
-- cartridge carries no names for its specials, and when this was written
-- pokeemerald's list looked as though it could not be indexed into safely --
-- its 527 names against this table's 530 entries, and a name transplanted by
-- an index that is off by one is a wrong answer wearing a right one's
-- clothes.
--
-- So the match is on SHAPE instead, which no renumbering can move.  (The
-- list CAN be indexed into: three pairs of entries in the cartridge's own
-- table share a function pointer, the importer finds those three pairs
-- knowing no names at all, and they fall on exactly the three repeated names
-- in pret's file.  src/script/Gen3Specials.lua carries the alignment and the
-- proof, and every derivation below turned out to agree with it -- which is
-- what makes it a proof rather than a hope.  The shape argument is left
-- standing because it is what established these two, and because it is the
-- check the alignment was tested against.)  Route
-- 101's rescue script decodes here as
--
--     fadescreen 1 / removeobject 4 / setobjectxy 255 / applymovement 255 /
--     waitmovement / special 159 / waitstate / applymovement 2 /
--     waitmovement / msgbox "PROF. BIRCH: Whew..." / special 0
--
-- and pokeemerald's Route101_EventScript_BirchsBag is that same sequence
-- command for command, with `special ChooseStarter` and `special
-- HealPlayerParty` in those two positions.  A sequence of ten commands
-- agreeing exactly, around a line of dialogue that only occurs once, is an
-- identification; the index it happens to sit at is not.
--
-- WHY IT MATTERS: there is no `givemon` anywhere in that script.  The whole
-- of choosing a starter lives inside the special, so without it the player
-- reaches Birch's lab having never been given a Pokemon and the game cannot
-- move.  It is the single most load-bearing call in Hoenn.
--
-- THE WHOLE SCENE IS INSIDE THE SPECIAL, and that is why three separate
-- things a player expects were missing at once.  Route 101's script is
--
--     special 159 / waitstate / applymovement 2 / msgbox "PROF. BIRCH:
--     Whew..." / special 0
--
-- so between the call and Birch thanking you there is not one script command.
-- Everything the cartridge does in that gap is C, and all of it belongs here:
--
--   THE CHOICE, with its confirm box -- the picture and "Do you choose this
--   POKeMON?" -- which Gen3StarterSelect draws.
--
--   THE FIRST BATTLE.  The Pokemon that jumped Birch is fought immediately,
--   before the screen ever returns to the route: pokeemerald hands the
--   starter over and then goes straight into a battle rather than back to
--   the overworld.  It is the only battle in the game the player cannot
--   lose to -- the script's very next commands after Birch's line are
--   `special 0`, HealPlayerParty -- which is why `canLose` is set from the
--   same record rather than guessed.
--
--   AND NOT THE NICKNAME.  Emerald never asks for one when a Pokemon is
--   handed over; naming is always a separate script step.  Birch asks in his
--   lab, several rooms and one warp later, and that script is the one that
--   calls the naming screen (special 161).  Asking here put the keyboard up
--   on Route 101 with a Poochyena still standing over the professor.

-- call 40 and 95 call 41, which is not the tidy pairing a save/restore pair
-- ought to have).
--
-- gSpecials[40] and gSpecials[41] are mirror images.  Both walk six slots,

-- 228..232: THE CYCLING ROAD
--

-- GetPlayerAvatarBike, FinishCyclingRoadChallenge and UpdateCyclingRoadState,
-- in that order:
--
--   228 (0137EFC)  the record: VAR $4028 and $4029 are one 32-bit TIME in
--                  frames and VAR $4027 the collisions.  A zero time means
--                  there is no record yet, which is the 0 the sign tests.
--   229 (0137D0C)  the run starts: a flag, a zeroed collision count and the
--                  frame counter's current value, all in RAM rather than the
--                  save -- a run does not survive a reset on the cartridge
--                  either.
--   230 (0137D34)  WHICH BIKE: `& 4` first, so the ACRO answers 1 and the

--                  alphabetical and it is not the flag order; it is this.
--   231 (0137E6C)  the run ends: elapsed = now - start, and the pair is
--                  written down if it beats what is there.
--   232 (0137F44)  and leaving clears a run in progress -- states 2 and 3
--                  go back to 0, which is what stops a half-finished run

-- MAUVILLE GYM: 142, 143 AND 147, AND THE THIRD BADGE.
--
-- Wattson's gym is a maze of electric beams with four floor switches, and
-- pressing one flips every beam in the room.  The whole puzzle is three
-- specials and, unimplemented, the gym was NOT MERELY DECORATIVE -- it was
-- shut.  The shipped layout has the beams across row 7 raised, which is the
-- full width of the corridor between the door and Wattson, so the third gym
-- could be entered and not crossed.
--
-- Everything below is the cartridge's, and two independent readings agree on
-- it.  pokeemerald's sMauvilleGymSwitchCoords is (0,15), (4,12), (3,9),
-- (8,9); the four coord events the ROM puts in this map sit on exactly those
-- cells, and the shipped layout has METATILE_MauvilleGym_RaisedSwitch at all
-- four.  That is the alignment proof, and it is worth having because the
-- rest is a table of 24 metatile ids.
--
-- 143 MauvilleGymPressSwitch presses the one in 0x8004 and raises the other
-- three.  142 MauvilleGymSetDefaultBarriers is misnamed on the cartridge
-- too: it TOGGLES every beam in the window -- green on becomes green off,
-- off becomes on, a vertical beam becomes its own pole and back -- which is
-- why pressing any switch changes the whole room.  147
-- MauvilleGymDeactivatePuzzle presses all four and turns everything off,
-- which is what a returning champion walks into.
--
-- WHY THE FLAG ON EACH ROW MATTERS.  MapGridSetMetatileIdAt writes the
-- metatile and the collision bits in one halfword, so every one of these
-- assignments states passability: the bare form is "you may walk here" and
-- the `| MAPGRID_IMPASSABLE` form is "you may not".  A beam's TOP half is
-- always passable and its BOTTOM half is the wall, which is why the H3/H4
-- rows carry the flag and H1/H2 never do.
--
-- The table is checkable rather than trusted.  The gym's own ON_LOAD can
-- reach a script of 26 `setmetatile` rows -- the cartridge's second beam
-- layout, written out by hand -- and running 142 over the shipped layout
-- reproduces it exactly, tile for tile and flag for flag.  The suite does
-- that against the ROM.

-- or deleted a move nobody had picked.

-- there rather than from folklore, which has the two the other way round.

-- WHICH BARE `special` STILL ANSWERS.
--
-- `specialvar` names the var to put the answer in, and this file has always
-- honoured that.  A bare `special` names none -- but on the cartridge that
-- does not mean the answer is thrown away: the special FUNCTION writes
-- gSpecialVar_Result (0x020375F0) itself, and the script's very next
-- instruction is usually `compare VAR_RESULT, n / goto_if`.
--
-- gSpecials sits at 081DBA64, immediately after the 22-entry gSpecialVars
-- table at 081DBA0C -- which is how VAR_RESULT is known to be script id
-- $800D at 0x020375F0 in the first place.  Walking all 527 entries and
-- looking for a store to that address gives the list below: 57 write it in
-- the special's own body, 7 more through a helper they always call.
--
-- The rest must NOT write it.  Thirty-five specials write $8004..$8007
-- instead -- GetSecretBaseTypeInFrontOfPlayer is one of them -- and five
-- only READ VAR_RESULT, so writing it for them would clobber the value the
-- script is about to compare.  That is why this is a list and not a rule.

  -- into a var, 218 of them compare it within three instructions, and every
  -- one of those 218 was branching on a stale value.
  --
  -- Zero, because it is the answer that means no, none, zero of them, and

  -- is a repeatable one that shows up the same way every run; a stale one is
  -- a different bug each time the player takes a different route to it.

  --
  -- `specialvar` names the var and is handled above.  A bare `special` names
  -- none -- but sixty-four of the cartridge's specials write
  -- gSpecialVar_Result themselves, and the script's next instruction is the
  -- compare that reads it.  RESULT_SPECIALS is that list.  Answering for the
  -- ones this port HAS was only half the job: an unimplemented one on that
  -- list still left VAR_RESULT holding whatever the last unrelated check
  -- put there, and 73 sites in Hoenn branch on exactly that -- the quiz
  -- lady's bag menu, the contest entry, the Lilycove ferry's destination
  -- list, the Dewford painting, and thirty-seven others.
  --
  -- Zero for the same reason as above: it is the answer that means no, none

-- `goto_if 1` branched on whatever happened to be in the comparison register
-- from the last unrelated check. Answering the question -- even with "no" --
-- is what keeps the script's shape.
--
-- Three kinds here, and they are labelled as such rather than blurred:
--
--   ANSWERED    the port has a real answer and gives it.
--   STUBBED     the port has no such feature (contests, the slot machine,
--               the rotating-tile puzzles, the Pokenav). The op is
--               RECOGNISED, sets whatever the following branch reads, and
--               logs once. The script continues down its "not now" path
--               instead of down a random one.
--   RECORDED    a setter with nowhere to put its value yet; kept on the save
--               so nothing is silently lost and a later feature can read it.

-- ZERO IS THE PLAYER: the player walked the reporters' choreography while

-- Marine Cave or Terra Cave, whichever holds the one still out there.  None of
-- it ever happened here, and the reason was not the routes: thirty-six places
-- in Hoenn already compare VAR_ABNORMAL_WEATHER_LOCATION and put the weather
-- and the cave mouth on the map when it names them.  The var was never set.
--
-- 491 sets it.  Which half of the table it picks is the cartridge's own test
-- (0813B2E4): one flag sends the player to the first cave, the other to the
-- second, and with neither set a coin decides -- and then eight spots inside

-- fell through to the Game Boy's PC menu -- the same complaint the bedroom's
-- PC drew ("I get the gen1 menus").
--
-- The rows are built rather than listed, which is why they are a special and
-- not a multichoice list: the first is SOMEONE'S PC until you have met
-- Lanette and LANETTE'S PC afterwards, and HALL OF FAME only exists once the
-- game is cleared.  Both flags and all five labels are the cartridge's (see
-- pcMultichoice).
--
-- THE ANSWER IS THE ROW INDEX, raw -- the input task writes what the menu
-- returns and nothing remaps it -- so with no HALL OF FAME row, LOG OFF is
-- row 2 and the script's own `checkflag` on the HALL OF FAME arm is what
-- sends it to the log-off script instead.  That is the cartridge's guard, and
-- keeping the raw index is what lets it work.

--         (English) answer 1 straight away, and otherwise compare the
--         nickname against gSpeciesNames[MON_DATA_SPECIES(11)] -- eleven
--         bytes a name, at 083185C8 -- answering 1 when they differ.
--
--       So "nicknamed" is not a bit on the Pokemon: the cartridge keeps no
--       such bit.  It is the nickname failing to match the species name,

--
--       THE LANGUAGE HALF HAS NO PORT EQUIVALENT.  A retail cartridge can
--       hold a Pokemon traded in from a Japanese game and the rater refuses

-- THE MAUVILLE OLD MAN, and the decoration TRADER (100, and 116 to 121).
--
-- The house east of Mauville's gym holds one of five men, and which one it is
-- was decided the moment the save was rolled: `(trainer id % 10) / 2` indexes
-- SetMauvilleOldMan's five-armed jump table -- Bard, Hipster, TRADER,
-- Storyteller, Giddy.  His script opens
--
--     special 100 / copyvar 0x8000, VAR_RESULT
--     compare 0x8000, 0 / goto_if eq <bard>       ... and so on to four
--
-- and with 100 unimplemented VAR_RESULT still held whatever the LAST script
-- put there, so the house dispatched on a stale number: the man in it stood
-- silent, or answered as somebody he was not.
--
-- WHY IT IS COMPUTED RATHER THAN STORED AT NEW GAME.  The cartridge rolls it
-- once and writes the answer into SaveBlock1; this derives it from the
-- trainer id the first time anybody asks.  Those are the same answer -- the
-- id never changes -- and doing it on demand is what lets a save made before
-- this existed find its man too, instead of defaulting everybody to the Bard.
-- A save imported from a real cartridge brings the block with it and this
-- never runs.
--
-- THE TRADER, then.  He carries four decorations that belonged to four other
-- people, will swap any one of them for one of yours, and writes YOUR name
-- against whatever you hand him -- so the next person to meet him is told it
-- was yours.  His script (S028E4D4 and the four it reaches) is:
--
--     special 100 / ... / goto <trader>
--     "Want to trade decorations with me?" / YES/NO
--     special 117            -- have we traded before
--     special 116 / waitstate
--     compare 0x8004, 0      -- nothing to show
--     compare 0x8004, 65535  -- backed out
--     "That decorative item once belonged to {STR_VAR_1}." / YES/NO
--     special 118            -- you own nothing to give
--     "Okay, pick the decoration that you'll trade to me."
--     special 120 / waitstate
--     compare 0x8006, 0 / compare 0x8006, 65535
--     special 119            -- his would not fit in your PC
--     "so we'll trade my {STR_VAR_3} for your {STR_VAR_2}?" / YES/NO
--     special 121            -- the swap
--
-- Every var in that listing is the cartridge's own: 0x8004 is HIS decoration,
-- 0x8005 the slot it came out of, 0x8006 YOURS, and the three string buffers

-- THE STORYTELLER, the fourth of Mauville's five old men -- and the only one
-- of the five whose material is YOU.
--
-- The other four have something of their own to say: a song, a saying, a
-- decoration to trade, ten tales of nothing at all.  The Storyteller has
-- none.  Everything he knows he read off the player's own game statistics,
-- and every line he speaks is one of them read back with a flourish: "This
-- TRAINER saved the game 214 times!  A more cautious TRAINER than {PLAYER}
-- one will never find!"
--
-- HE KEEPS FOUR TALES and each one is a snapshot, not a live reading -- the
-- statistic AS IT STOOD when he wrote it down, plus the name of the TRAINER
-- it belonged to.  That is what makes the second half of his script work:
-- come back later, have him tell the same tale, and if the counter has moved
-- since he is impressed all over again and writes the new figure down.  A
-- port that read the statistic live would never surprise him.
--
-- ZERO MEANS EMPTY, which is the one thing here that looks like a mistake and
-- is not.  A free slot is a stat id of zero, so the statistic whose real id
-- IS zero -- the save counter, his first and most famous tale -- cannot be
-- stored as itself; the cartridge files it under another number and maps it
-- back when it reads the counter.  The extractor derives both the renaming
-- and the number.

--

-- LADY -- and only one lives in any given save.  WHICH ONE IS YOUR TRAINER
-- ID: InitLilycoveLady reads the public id, takes it modulo six and halves
-- it, so 0 is the quiz, 1 the favour and 2 the contest.  The same shape as
-- the Mauville old man's `(id % 10) / 2`, and worth saying out loud, because
-- it means two players in three never meet the FAVOR LADY at all.
--
-- gSpecials[365] is the lobby's whole dispatch and it was unserved, so the
-- script branched on whatever VAR_RESULT happened to hold and the room was
-- non-deterministic.  Serving it makes the lobby answer the same way twice.
--
-- WHAT THE FAVOR LADY WANTS is one of six adjectives -- slippery, roundish,
-- wham-ish, shiny, sticky, pointy -- and each one names a list of items she
-- will accept.  FIVE liked things satisfy her, and then she hands over one of
-- six premium prizes: a LUXURY BALL, a NUGGET, a PROTEIN, a HEART SCALE, a
-- RARE CANDY or a PP MAX.  extractFavorLady finds all four tables by
-- requiring them to tile -- the lists are packed behind the adjectives and
-- the pointer table starts exactly where the last one ends -- so nothing here
-- is addressed by hand.
--
-- WHAT THIS DOES NOT CARRY is the other players' half.  On a cartridge the
-- record travels through record mixing, which is how somebody else's name
-- ends up on the item she is holding; 368 and 370 read that name, and with no
-- link there is never one, so she asks you instead.  That is the same answer
-- a cartridge that has never mixed gives.

-- THE SS TIDAL, Hoenn's ferry -- two specials that only work as a pair.
--
-- 500 builds the list of places the ship will take you FROM WHERE YOU ARE
-- STANDING, and 501 turns the row you picked back into a place.  Both were
-- unserved, so the sailor's menu came up empty and the branch after it read
-- whatever VAR_RESULT was last left holding.
--
-- THE ROW IS NOT THE DESTINATION.  Every destination is appended only if you
-- can go there, so the menu is a different length in different saves and the
-- third row means a different island depending on which tickets are in the
-- bag.  That is the whole reason for the second special, and why serving one
-- without the other would be worse than serving neither.
--
-- WHAT EACH ONE COSTS is derived (see extractSSTidal): the first two are the
-- port's own two, gated on where you are standing and one flag; the four
-- ISLANDS each want a TICKET IN THE BAG and the flag that opens the place;
-- and the last row is always there because it is the way out.
--
-- THE ONE-SHOT ARM.  Standing at the OTHER dock, an island is offered only
-- while its own second flag is clear -- and offering it sets that flag.  That
-- is the cartridge's own arm and it is kept: it is what stops the far dock
-- listing an island you have already been told about from there.
-- THE FOUR NAMES BELOW HANG OFF THE MODULE TABLE rather than being file
-- locals.  This chunk is already at Lua's 200-local ceiling and one more at
-- file scope will not load -- the limit counts locals live at that point, so
-- a `do` block does not buy anything here either.  Same reason

-- THE LINK, ANSWERED THE WAY A CARTRIDGE WITH NOTHING PLUGGED IN ANSWERS IT.
--
-- Sixty-odd call sites across Hoenn belong to hardware this port does not
-- have and is not pretending to have: a serial cable and a wireless adapter.
-- The port DOES have link play -- src/link/LinkState.lua, peer to peer over
-- the network -- but it is a different thing reached by its own route, not a
-- reimplementation of the GBA's serial handshake, and no script on this
-- cartridge knows about it.
--
-- SO THE HONEST ANSWER IS THE ONE THE CARTRIDGE ITSELF GIVES with nothing
-- attached, and the scripts prove that is a real, supported state rather than
-- a hole -- every one of them already has the arm for it:
--
--     specialvar VAR_RESULT, 415        <- IsWirelessAdapterConnected
--     compare_var_to_value VAR_RESULT, 0
--     goto_if 1, <the rest of the conversation>
--
-- That branch is not an error path.  It is what the shop assistant says when
-- you have not bought the adapter, and until now the port never reached it:
-- an unimplemented special left VAR_RESULT holding whatever the last script
-- put there, so the answer to "have you got an adapter" was a coin toss.
--
-- WHAT IS *NOT* IN THIS BLOCK is anything that would leave the player stuck.
-- The two cable-club warps are served properly further down, because the room
-- they lead to is a real map with a real door.

-- a function that discards it; the real answer is in two little functions

-- RomExtractorGen3:partyChoice).  The rule:
--
--     the facility variable is 8 or 9   -- a multi battle -- fixed numbers

--                                          before the call
--
