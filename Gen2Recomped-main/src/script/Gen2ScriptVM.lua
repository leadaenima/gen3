-- The Gen2 script VM.
--
-- data/generated/map_scripts.lua holds the ROM's own bytecode, disassembled by
-- src/import/RomExtractorGen2.lua: one flat pool of scripts keyed by
-- S<bank>_<addr>, one pool of applymovement data keyed by M<bank>_<addr>, and
-- a per-map index of scenes, callbacks, coord events and object scripts.
--
-- compile() lowers a script and everything it can reach into a single
-- ScriptRunner row list.  Because the ROM's `scall` is a real call, the lowered
-- form keeps a return stack (g2_call / g2_return in Gen2Commands) rather than
-- inlining, so a shared subroutine appears once no matter how many callers it
-- has.
--
-- Anything the port has no equivalent for lowers to nothing at all: an
-- unrecognised command is skipped, which degrades a scene rather than killing
-- the script.  register() therefore attaches these as *base* contributions,
-- behind the hand-ported data/scripts/ modules, which still win outright.

-- ScriptCheckCondition (engine/script_conditionals.asm) sets carry when the
-- guarded body should RUN, and the six are six genuinely different tests:
--
--   .false        ld a, c / cp 1     -- runs when the variable is ZERO

  -- The ROM runs exactly one scene -- the one wMapScenes names for this map.
  -- Running all of them would fire every cutscene state the map has ever had
  -- the moment the player walks in.
  --
  -- Callbacks come FIRST.  In the engine they are not "the rest of the map
  -- script": RunMapCallback fires them from LoadMapAttributes while the map is
  -- still being set up, and the scene script only starts once the map is live
  -- (via the scene's own priorityjump).  So a callback that stages the cast is
  -- guaranteed to have run before the scene that walks the player up to it.
  --
  -- Crystal's ElmsLab is the case that proves it, and it is a Crystal-only
  -- shape -- Gold's ElmsLab_MapScripts declares ZERO callbacks:
  --
  --   ElmsLabMoveElmCallback:  checkscene / iftrue .Skip
  --                            moveobject ELMSLAB_ELM, 3, 4 / endcallback
  --
  -- ELM's object_event sits at (5,2), which is where he ends up AFTER the
  -- meeting (ElmsLab_ElmToDefaultPositionMovement1/2 walk him up-right-right-up
  -- from 3,4 to exactly 5,2).  The callback is what puts him at (3,4) for the
  -- meeting itself, and Crystal's ElmsLab_WalkUpToElmMovement is built for that
  -- spot: 7 steps up then turn_head_LEFT, where Gold's is 9 steps up then
  -- turn_head_RIGHT.  Queueing the scene first left ELM parked at (5,2): the
  -- player walked up and faced an empty tile, then ELM's "walk back to my
  -- desk" movements ran from the wrong origin and carried him off the walkable
  -- area.
