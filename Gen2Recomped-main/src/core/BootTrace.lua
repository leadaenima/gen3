-- Boot breadcrumbs for platforms where you cannot watch the app die.
--
-- On desktop a crash is self-explanatory: the blue error screen names the file
-- and the line.  On Android and the Switch it is not.  The window is up for
-- about a second and then the process is gone, and the two things that would
-- normally tell you why are both unavailable -- logcat needs a cable and adb,
-- and love.errorhandler's crash.txt only ever fires for a LUA error.  A native
-- abort (an OOM kill, a JNI check failure, a driver fault) reaches no Lua
-- handler at all, so it leaves crash.txt completely empty and the absence
-- looks identical to "nothing went wrong".
--
-- This closes that gap from the other side: instead of recording the failure,
-- record the PROGRESS, so the last line written is the stage the process did
-- not survive.  Every mark is an open-write-close, never a buffered handle, so
-- the file on disk is current even when the next instruction kills us.
--
-- The player can read it with a file manager, no cable:
--   Android  Android/data/<package>/files/boot_trace.txt
--   Switch   <SD>/switch/gen2recomp/Gen2Recomp/boot_trace.txt
--   desktop  the LOVE save folder, beside save.lua
--
-- Deliberately cheap and deliberately always-on: a dozen short lines per
-- launch, truncated at the start of each run, so it can never grow without
-- bound and there is never a "turn it on and reproduce it" round trip -- the
-- run that failed has already written it.

-- mark it writes would otherwise call begin(), read the bundled half of THIS
-- launch out of the file, and truncate it.
--
-- That read is what put "PREVIOUS LAUNCH DID NOT FINISH" on screen at every
-- launch of an updated build: the bundled prefix legitimately has no "booted"
-- line yet -- booting is what it was in the middle of -- so the payload
-- diagnosed the launch it was itself part of as a failed one.  The trace shown
