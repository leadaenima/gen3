-- pair, most GameSir models -- numbers its axes however its driver likes, so
-- the stick arrived on 3/4 (or 4/5) and nothing was listening: "the analog
-- stick isn't working".  GamepadMap.loadMappings fixes the pads that can be
-- named; this fixes the rest, by watching which axes actually move.
--
-- The rule: the first axis to cross the press threshold claims the stick,
-- and its PARTNER is the other half of the pair (axes arrive x-then-y, so an
-- odd index pairs with the one after it and an even with the one before).
-- Triggers are the thing not to adopt -- they rest at -1 and swing to +1 --
-- so an axis never seen near zero is refused.  Learned per joystick, and the
-- table is weak-keyed so unplugging a pad forgets it.
-- THE PAD THAT IS NOT AN OBJECT.  A Linux handheld with no SDL
-- game-controller mapping sends raw axes and hats with NO joystick at all --
-- which is the exact case this whole raw path exists to serve -- and `nil` is
-- not a table key: `self._rawSticks[nil] = st` raises "table index is nil"
-- and takes the input handler down with it.  Every stick movement on that
-- hardware, on the one code path written for that hardware.
