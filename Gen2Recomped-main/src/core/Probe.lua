-- A DIAGNOSTIC THAT ACTUALLY REACHES THE DISK.
--
-- Every attempt to diagnose a field-time draw bug from log.txt came back with
-- an EMPTY FILE, repeatedly, and the reason is in src/core/Logger.lua: it
-- buffers and only writes once 64 lines have piled up (FLUSH_AT), or on an
-- [error] line -- and it truncates log.txt on boot, rotating the previous run
-- aside.  A handful of diagnostic lines produced while walking around is
-- always fewer than 64, so they sat in the buffer until the game closed and
-- the next boot threw them away.  That is exactly the right trade for a
-- logger (a per-line filesystem round trip in an update loop is the very lag
-- it would be used to diagnose) and exactly the wrong one for this.
--
-- So: its own file, one line at a time, written and closed immediately, and
-- capped per tag so a call in a draw loop cannot fill a disk.  It is for
-- answering a specific question once, not for logging.
