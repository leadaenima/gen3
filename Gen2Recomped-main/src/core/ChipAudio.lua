-- Playback front end for the Game Boy audio synth (src/core/ChipSynth.lua).
--
-- Map/battle MUSIC is streamed from a background worker thread
-- (src/core/chip_worker.lua): the worker synthesizes the PCM buffers and this
-- module only queues finished SoundData onto a QueueableSource.  That is the
-- fix for the map-transition stutter -- filling the deep (~6s) playback queue
-- from scratch when a song changes is ~200ms of Lua synthesis, and doing it on
-- the render thread dropped frames for the ~10 frames after every seam
-- crossing.  Off-thread, a song change costs the main loop essentially
-- nothing.
--
-- When love.thread is unavailable (the headless test stub) or a worker fails
-- to start, music falls back to the original synchronous, amortized queue fill
-- so behavior is unchanged -- see the `threaded` branch in each entry point.
--
-- SFX and cries stay synchronous: they are short one-shots rendered once into
-- a static Source, not a per-frame streaming cost.

-- underrun recovery -- is about MOVING PCM, not about making it.  Gen 3's
-- music is made by a completely different engine (src/core/M4ASynth.lua: a
-- sequencer over sampled instruments, not four Game Boy channels), and the
-- only thing this file has to know about it is that it answers the same three
-- methods: sample, sampleStereo, finished.
--
-- So a song def carries the name of the synth that can play it and every path
-- here goes through this one lookup.  A def with no name is a Game Boy song,
-- which is every song this module was originally written for.
