  -- party was six panels of text with a blank where the Pokemon should be.
  -- Unblocked and NOT produced it would be worse -- the overlay is additive,

  -- Hoenn species would wear a Kanto icon chosen by dex number.  Which is why
  -- the import gate requires the file: a cache without it is reported
  -- incomplete rather than booting on somebody else's art.
  "icons",
  -- `field` IS NOW EMERALD'S OWN, and this is the second module to make the
  -- move (see GEN3_BORROWED below, which `sprites` emptied).
  --
  -- It was in CLASSIC_ONLY for a real reason: field.lua is where boot.startMap
  -- and boot.screens live, the overlay is additive, and a Gen 3 cache with no
  -- field of its own read RED'S -- which is how NEW GAME on Emerald opened
  -- Red's intro in Red's house.  Blocking it fixed that.
  --
  -- But extractHealLocations now WRITES one: sHealLocations, the fly warps and
  -- the order the region map lists them in.  Blocked, that file was produced,
  -- required by the import gate, and then thrown away on load -- so FlyMenu
  -- had no destinations and every blackout in Hoenn fell back.  Emerald's own
  -- table carries no boot keys at all, so what it inherits now is nothing
  -- rather than another game's.
  "field",
  -- `audio` made the same move, and for a louder reason: the region was
  -- SILENT.  The Gen 3 extractor writes mapSongs (which of the 611 songs each
  -- of the 518 maps plays) and Music.playMap reads exactly that -- so blocked,
  -- `data.audio` was nil, playMap chose no song, and not one map in Hoenn had
  -- a theme.  The import gate has required audio.lua all along, in as many
  -- words: "a cache without it is a region that boots and is silent".  It was
  -- required by one file and refused by another.

-- The version overlay is ADDITIVE: CacheFs mounts emerald/data/generated over

-- resolves -- to whatever the ROOT cache holds, which is Red's.  That is not
-- a hypothetical.  It is why NEW GAME on Emerald opened Red's intro, Red's
-- main menu and Red's REDS_HOUSE_2F: `field` is where boot.startMap and
-- boot.screens live, and Emerald was reading Red's.
--
-- So a Gen 3 cache is not offered them at all.  Each of these is Gen 1/Gen 2
-- shaped -- keyed by Gen 1 ids, Gen 1 script structures, Gen 1 art -- and a
-- Gen 3 dataset that appears to have one is reading another game's.

-- ------- Gen 2 BG palettes, published where a renderer can find them
--
-- The ROM colours the overworld in two halves: the tileset's PalMap says
-- which of eight palettes each 8x8 tile wears, and EnvironmentColorsPointers
-- says what those eight palettes ARE for this map's environment at this time
-- of day (LoadMapPals).  The importer writes both onto the tileset record --
-- `palMap` and `palColorsByTod` -- and TileRenderer bakes them into the atlas
-- it draws with.  So the data was always here; it was only ever reachable by
-- knowing those two field names.
--
-- That is fine for the 2D renderer, which lives in this repo.  It is not fine
-- for anything ELSE that has to reproduce the same colouring -- a voxel or 3D
-- pipeline meshes the map once and samples the atlas directly, so it cannot
-- use the per-quad bake and must do the substitution itself, landing on
-- exactly the colours the 2D tiles would have.  Handing it the raw generated
-- sheet instead gives a correct world in four shades of grey, which is what
-- STADIUM2_OVERWORLD_MODELS rendered: geometry, lighting and shadows all
-- right, every surface monochrome.
--
-- Two names make that reachable:
--
--   Data.gen2Palettes[tilesetId][tod] -> { pal1 .. pal8 }, pal = {r,g,b} x4
--     the palette SET, addressed the way the ROM addresses it.  A live view
--     over self.tilesets rather than a copy, so a mod that replaces a
--     tileset's colours is seen by the next lookup.
--
--   tileset.tilePalettes                tileset.palMap, one-based
--     the tile -> palette-slot map under the name the other engines in this
--     lineage use.  NOT an alias: palMap holds the raw ROM nibble, 0-7, and
--     gen2TileColors adds the one when it indexes palColors.  A reader given
--     the raw table has no way to know that, and one that assumes a direct
--     index silently draws every tile in its neighbour's colours -- grass in
--     the tree palette, water in the sand palette -- which looks like a
--     plausible palette rather than a bug.  So this table holds 1-8 and is
--     indexable as-is.  It costs one array per tileset, once.

-- MAP EDITOR OVERLAY, applied LAST and over the top.
--
-- The editor never writes into data/generated_* -- that tree is rebuilt from
-- the cartridge on every import, so an edit stored there would be destroyed by
-- the next one, silently. It keeps its patches in the save directory and they
-- are laid over whatever the load produced, which is what lets a re-import
-- replace the base and keep the edits.
--
-- A METHOD, BECAUSE IT HAS TO RUN TWICE. See Game:load: mods load AFTER this
-- data does, and a content mod may patch the very maps the editor has edits
-- for -- which is not hypothetical, it is what a map pack exported from this
-- editor and installed back into it does by construction. `maps:patch`
-- replaces the def's `objects` wholesale with the snapshot taken at export, so
-- an NPC added after that export was applied here, overwritten there, and gone
-- with every step of the process reporting success.
--
-- The working copy wins. A mod is published content and the edit store is what
-- the reader is editing RIGHT NOW; when the two describe the same map, the one
-- they can still see and change is the one that should be on screen.
--
-- Wrapped whole: a malformed edit file must not be able to stop the game
-- booting. The worst case is the edits do not apply and the log says so.
