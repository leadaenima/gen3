-- Base files a mod needs but cannot ship: `required_imports` in manifest.json.

-- Some mods are extractors.  STADIUM2_IMPORTER rips models out of a Pokemon
-- Stadium 2 cartridge; it cannot legally ship the cartridge, and the sandbox
-- gives a mod no way to reach outside its own folder, so the mod's own
-- discovery ends in "the engine sandbox has no scoped external ROM picker".
-- The manifest has always DECLARED the requirement:
--
--   "required_imports": [ {
--       "id": "stadium2_rom", "name": "Pokemon Stadium 2 (USA) ROM",
--       "file": "baseroms/stadium2.z64", "format": "n64",
--       "size": 67108864, "md5": "1561c75d..." } ]
--
-- and the engine ignored the field completely, so the only way to satisfy it
-- was to unzip the release, drop a 64 MB file inside it, re-zip and reinstall.
-- That is the "I can't import the Stadium 2 ROM" report.
--
-- What this module does is simple on purpose: it writes the player's file
-- INTO THE MOD'S OWN FOLDER at the declared path.  Every mod already reads its
-- own folder (`mod:read(relative)`), so a mod needs no new API and no change
-- at all to pick the file up -- STADIUM2_IMPORTER's Discovery.find() looks in
-- exactly the two places this writes to.  The engine's job is only to get the
-- bytes there, and to refuse the wrong file before it does.
