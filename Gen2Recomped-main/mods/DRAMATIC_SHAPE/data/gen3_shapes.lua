-- Voxel world mode: THE GEN 3 SHAPE PROFILE.
--
-- Hand-authored by this mod and read only from here.  Nothing below is
-- extracted, derived or copied from the ROM; nothing here reaches gameplay,
-- collision or scripts.  An entry can only ever change how a cell LOOKS.
--
-- This is the Gen 3 counterpart of `collision` in data/voxel_heights.lua, and
-- it is deliberately a SEPARATE table rather than more rows in that one.  Gen
-- 2 collision classes and Gen 3 behaviour bytes are two unrelated numberings
-- that overlap end to end -- $02 is tall grass here and a wall class there --
-- so merging them would not make a bigger table, it would make a wrong one.
-- And it would be wrong SILENTLY, which is the failure mode this mod has paid
-- for more than once.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT A BEHAVIOUR BYTE IS
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Every Gen 3 metatile carries a 16-bit attributes word.  Its low byte is the
-- BEHAVIOUR: one of 240 named values saying what kind of surface this is.
-- Bits 12-15 are the LAYER TYPE.  Bits 8-11 are unused in Emerald -- there is
-- no terrain-type and no encounter-type field here, whatever FireRed does.
--
-- The behaviour says what a cell IS, not whether you can walk on it.
-- Passability is the map CELL's business (the blockdata word's collision
-- bits), because in Gen 3 the same metatile is a wall in one place and a
-- doorway in another -- a house front and its door are one tile.  So
-- MB_NORMAL tells you almost nothing on its own, and most of the world is
-- MB_NORMAL: the rows below are the cells that DO announce themselves, and
-- Gen3.classAt handles the rest from the collision bit and the layer type.
--
-- Every behaviour Emerald actually defines has a row.  The 75 MB_UNUSED_*
-- values do not, and that is the whole of what is missing.
--
-- Classes are this mod's own vocabulary (lib/TileShape.lua, FALLBACK_HEIGHTS)
-- with three added for Gen 3:
--
--   bridge   a DECK: flat, thin, standing at its cell's own elevation with a
--            fascia down its open sides.
--   log      a floating raft, riding barely clear of the water.
--   slope    a ramp between two elevations, taking its rise from the cells on
--            either side rather than from a height of its own.

    -- (7 row pairs, exact palette-index equality) -- rows 4/13, 5/12, 6/11,
    -- 7/10 and 8/9 are identical and 3/14 differs in one pixel.  That is a
    -- WHEEL SEEN FROM DIRECTLY ABOVE and it cannot be a front face: nothing
    -- drawn face-on in a Gen 3 interior is its own reflection in a
    -- horizontal line, because a standing object has a top, a body and a
    -- base (the slot machine's own 548 reads 0.420, 556 reads 0.607, 564
    -- reads 0.552).  547/554/555 continue the table as the betting grid,
    -- also from above; 562/563 close it with six rows of front apron and
    -- then four rows of the room's own carpet.  That is a table lying on

    -- MossdeepCity_GameCorner_1F's tables at (2..3, 7) and (7..8, 7) --
    -- which the pixel carve in `Gen3.buildScenery` already calls `tabletop`

  -- here, on the one question the class cannot answer: what, if anything,
  -- does this drawing state is STANDING on the cell.
  --
  -- Measured over all 518 maps, on the shape surface (the atlas with the

  --   * the DRAWING states less, not more: the road's south fascia is ONE
  --     cell row of art (metatile 774/777 on Route 110's row 58) against 36px

  --
  -- Resolution order is primary tileset, then secondary, then the map by
  -- name (lib/Gen3.lua) -- most general to most specific, each overlaying
  -- the last.  Names are pokeemerald's, resolved through data/gen3_maps.lua,

  --               whichever of 0..15 it likes and skips the rest -- so the

  -- cells is worse than no rule at all.
  --
  -- So interiors are hand-pinned per tileset, exactly the way the Gen 1 and

  --
  -- 1. PIN THE FRONT ROW, NOT THE WALL BAND. Emerald draws a kitchen as two
  --    rows -- the upper doors up in the wall band, the carcasses in the row
  --    below -- and both are blocked. Unpinned they all flood into ONE region
  --    and `buildVolume` measures a single run three cells deep and 48px
  --    tall: the wall dragged forward around the fridge. Pinning the FRONT
  --    row takes it out of the flood, so the wall measures its own two cells
  --    and the units stand out in front of it. Pinning the wall band as well
  --    would be worse than doing nothing -- an authored cell leaves the
  --    flood, so each wall cell would become its own 16px box and the wall
  --    would stop being a wall.
  --
  -- 2. A PINNED CELL NEED NOT BE BLOCKED. Emerald leaves chair cells
  --    PASSABLE -- you walk over them -- so the passability guard that
  --    normally stops a walkable cell becoming furniture is bypassed for a
  --    pin. Stepping onto a chair and standing 8px up is what the drawing
  --    depicts.
  --
  -- Classes: chair / tabletop (drawn from above, art on the top face);
  -- worktop / sink / appliance / cabinet / tv (drawn face-on, art folds up
  -- the south face); bed (from above, low).

      -- the cabinet's dark top band is the LAST THREE ROWS of the cell above
      -- (metatile 578 in Brendan's living room, 582 in May's) and the two
      -- pale blue speaker panels are the FIRST EIGHT ROWS of the cell below
      -- (586 / 691 downstairs, 605 in both bedrooms).  3 + 16 + 8 = 27.
      -- Those two cells are WALKABLE FLOOR, so their eleven rows were being
      -- painted flat on the floorboards while the middle cell stood up --
      -- which is this project's standing complaint about a picture painted
      -- on a surface instead of a standing object, one cell above and one
      -- cell below every television in these four rooms.
      --
      -- A PIN IS THE WHOLE FIX; NO NEW MACHINERY IS NEEDED.  The forced
      -- billboard region floods over neighbouring cells that share the CLASS
      -- (lib/Structures.lua: "same CLASS, not just billboard art"), so
      -- classing the top and the base `console` too pools all three cells
      -- into one region and `buildObject` cuts ONE silhouette out of the
      -- pooled drawing -- 8-connected, so the cabinet stays whole across the
      -- cell seams -- and `console`'s one-object contract drops the loose
      -- scraps (May's rug edge at the bottom of 691, the floorboard nail
      -- dots).  The claimed cells are repainted with the commonest flat
      -- neighbour, which is the floorboard, so the floor closes behind it.
      --
      -- THESE FOUR IDS ARE THE OBJECT AND NOTHING ELSE, which is what makes
      -- pinning a walkable floor cell safe here.  MEASURED over all 518 maps:
      -- 578, 582 and 586 lay ONE CELL EACH, on one map each, and 605 lays
      -- two -- the same cell of the two bedrooms.  Not one of them is a
      -- generic floor id, and no other cell in Hoenn can move.
      --
      -- 691 IS MAY'S LIVING-ROOM BASE AND IS DELIBERATELY NOT PINNED.  It is
      -- the same drawing as Brendan's 586 and the pin would be the same pin,
      -- and it cannot work: the FLIGHT DETECTOR has already claimed that cell.
      -- Its two pale blue speaker panels are banded light-then-dark like a
      -- run of treads, so `Structures.buildStairs` marks the cell `art =
      -- "stair"`, and the billboard region pools only cells whose art is
      -- `billboard` -- so the pinned cell would sit outside the television's
      -- region and take no part in it.  MEASURED, with the pin in: May's set
      -- stayed 19 world pixels while Brendan's went to 27, and the only
      -- thing the pin changed was to lift that misread cell from h = 0 to
      -- `console`'s h = 16.  MEASURED over all 518 maps with the pin in, it
      -- is also the ONLY pinned cell in Hoenn the flight detector marks --
      -- so no chair pinned below can meet this, and the misreading is a
      -- separate defect in its own right (it is what stands a staircase in
      -- May's living room today, pin or no pin) and not this round's report.

    -- the corner plant move nothing but themselves; 584 would flip the lab
    -- bench cells 560 and 576 from `tabletop` to `cylinder`, and 558 would

      -- ---- AND WHAT THIS BLOCK MOVES THAT IT DID NOT PIN -----------------
      -- THREE CELLS, all in LilycoveCity_PokemonTrainerFanClub: 770 at
      -- (9, 7), 771 at (10, 7) and 778 at (9, 8), which leave `canopy` and
      -- `cylinder` for `tabletop`.  They are the long white bench along that
      -- room's east wall, and 616 -- pinned `worktop` above -- stands in the
      -- very next cell, so taking it out of the blocked run shrinks that run
      -- under BOULDER_RUN_MAX and re-arms the round carve on its neighbours.
      -- MEASURED, the move is TOWARDS the answer the same drawing already
      -- has elsewhere: 771 resolves `tabletop` on 6 of its 7 cells and 770
      -- and 778 on 1 of their 2 each.  A bench is a top-down surface and
      -- `tabletop` is right for it.
      --
      -- 770/771/772/778/780 WERE TRIED AS PINS and taken out again, which is
      -- worth recording so nobody re-adds them: pinning that bench pulls its
      -- own neighbours 643 and 644 out of THEIR runs and drops them from
      -- `tabletop` to `cylinder` in DewfordTown_Hall and the Fan Club -- a
      -- couch lathed into a barrel, 4 cells, worse than the 3 it fixes.
      -- Holding those down needs 643/644 pinned too, and 643's third cell is
      -- in the Fan Club's own wall band, which rule 1 forbids.  Three cells
      -- moving to the right answer is the smaller error.
      --
      -- ---- AND WHAT COULD NOT BE PINNED FROM THIS FILE ------------------
      -- THE WIDE 3x2 DINING TABLE, and this is the one thing in the report
      -- this round does not fix.  IN-GAME LOCATION:
      -- RustboroCity_Flat1_2F (2..4, 4..5) -- the "wider table" in the room
      -- frame, with a chair west of it and two east -- and
      -- RustboroCity_House1 (3..5, 4..5).  Ids 744/894, 745/895, 746/910,
      -- 752/902, 753/903, 754/911; 29 cells, 4 of them (`745`/`895`'s and
      -- `753`/`903`'s middle column) resolving `wall`, which is the tall box
      -- in the frame.
      --
      -- `tabletop` is unambiguously the right CLASS for it and a pin would
      -- still make it worse, because the class is extruded per pixel from
      -- the map's own carve and IN THESE TWO ROOMS THE CARVE CANNOT SEE THE
      -- TABLE.  MEASURED, the same drawing over two different floors: baked
      -- over Mossdeep's, Dewford's and the Safari rest house's floor (ids
      -- 744/745/746) it carves to 206, 240 and 206 pixels of 256 and stands
      -- as a solid table; baked over Rustboro's pale-yellow check (ids
      -- 894/895/910) it carves to 42, 16 and 42, because the tablecloth is
      -- painted in a colour that floor is laid in.  895's sixteen surviving
      -- pixels are ONE ROW.  Pinned, the middle of the table would stand as
      -- a 1-pixel line and the cell would be flattened to floor under it.
      --
      -- That is a defect in how a thin carve is modelled, not in what the
      -- cell is, and the instrument that would fix it -- a boxed fallback
      -- for a `tabletop` whose carve falls under some fraction of its
      -- drawing -- lives in lib/Structures.lua, which this file does not get
      -- to edit.  Left unpinned and written down instead.
      --
      -- THE FRIDGE AND THE HOB ARE THE SAME STORY ONE STEP LESS SEVERE, and
      -- are pinned anyway: MEASURED, 896 carries 62 pixels after the grain
      -- filter and 855 carries 93, against 254 for the identical fridge in
      -- Littleroot.  What survives on the fridge is its whole OUTLINE --
      -- all four edges, both door seams and both handles -- so it stands as
      -- a fridge-shaped box rather than as a line, and standing in front of
      -- the wall at 32 is the report's ask either way.

      -- `tabletop` at (11..12, 6..7), which is the dining-set arrangement
      -- this file already pins in both children's living rooms.
      --
      -- `chair` (8) AND NOT `stool` (8): same height, but `chair` is the
      -- class `buildGen3Joinery` extrudes per pixel from the carve, and it
      -- is the class the chair-back rule reads.  A round stool has no back,
      -- and these do not get one: MEASURED over all 188 cells, the
      -- chair-back rule emits ZERO quads on every one of them.
      --
      -- CORRECTING THE REASON THIS BLOCK GAVE (g3-settee-305).  It said the
      -- rule declines because "its column-top profile is flat, exactly like
      -- 610".  It is not flat.  DERIVED, off the dumped carve, 550 and 564
      -- both profile 3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,3 -- a plateau at row 1, with
      -- a rounded cap either side of it.  The rule declined only because row
      -- 0 happens to be empty, which is luck and not a reading; one more row
      -- of cap and a cushion would have grown a backrest.  The gate in
      -- `buildGen3Joinery` now refuses on the plateau itself (1 < 3), so the
      -- outcome no longer depends on that.

      -- AND WHAT THE REPORT ACTUALLY SAW ON THESE CUSHIONS was never the
      -- back rule.  On 154 of the 188 cells the carve cuts the cushion in
      -- two and leaves a detached 10 x 1 bar floating at row 1, which the
