  -- puts on the read path. So the second boot in a process has two ways to
  -- get the first game's world, and it was taking both:
  --
  --   * the previous version's overlay was never unmounted, and Red's own
  --     mountVersion returns immediately (`cachePrefix == ""`, Red owns the
  --     root) without displacing it; and
  --   * even with the overlay gone, package.loaded still holds the tables the
  --     first game required under those names, so Data:load never reaches the
  --     disk at all.
  --
  -- The result is a game running on another game's data: Red booted after
  -- Crystal drew Crystal's maps with Crystal's tilesets, and Oak's Lab had
  -- Crystal's four objects instead of the three starter POKe BALLs -- so the
  -- room was wrong AND the starter could not be picked up, because the ball
  -- the player was walking up to was not in the map they were standing in.

  -- the OTHER game would boot it with this one's data". The Play path itself
  -- was never given the same treatment.
  --

  -- relaunching gets a clean Lua state, so "restart and it is fine" looked
  -- like the whole story. Android does not oblige: backing out of the app
  -- leaves the process resident, so reopening it resumes the same VM with the

-- Write every Lua error to a file before showing it.
--
-- On desktop the blue error screen IS the bug report -- you read it and you
-- know.  On Android and the Switch you cannot: the app closes, and the
-- traceback only ever existed in logcat or on a screen that was up for a
-- second.  Appending it to the save directory puts it somewhere a player can
-- actually reach: on Android that folder is the app's external-files
-- directory, browsable in any file manager under
-- Android/data/<package>/files/crash.txt, no USB and no adb.
--
-- Deliberately additive: the default handler still runs afterwards, so
-- desktop behaviour is unchanged.
--
-- AND the app must never disappear without saying why.  "It shows for a second
-- and closes, with no error" is not evidence of a native crash -- it is what an
-- ORDINARY Lua error looks like here, because of how LOVE's own boot code is
-- written.  From the engine vendored in this repo:
--
--   boot.lua        func = handler(...)   ...   while func do ... end   return 1
--   callbacks.lua   function love.errhand(msg)
--                     if not love.window or not love.graphics or not love.event
--                       then return end                      -- returns NIL
--                     if not love.graphics.isCreated() ... then
--                       local success, status = pcall(love.window.setMode, 800, 600)
--                       if not success or not status then return end   -- NIL
--
-- The error handler is expected to RETURN THE ERROR SCREEN'S main loop.  Every
-- one of those bare `return`s hands back nil, and boot.lua's `while func do`
-- then falls straight through to `return 1`: the process ends, having drawn
-- nothing.  Worse, boot.lua's deferErrhand sets `inerror = true` before calling
-- the handler, so if drawing the error screen ITSELF errors -- one nil index in
-- setMode, isCursorSupported, setNewFont -- the second error is routed to
-- error_printer, which prints to stdout (logcat, invisible on a phone) and also
-- returns nil.  Same silent exit.
--
-- So: write the traceback to a file the player can reach, and then guarantee a
-- visible screen even when the stock handler bails.  A crash that leaves NO
-- crash.txt AND no screen is then genuinely below Lua.
