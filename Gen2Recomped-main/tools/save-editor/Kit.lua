-- ------------------------------------------------- tapping away from a modal
--
-- A CLICK IS NOT CONSUMED BY THE WIDGET THAT ANSWERS IT. `Kit.mouseClicked`
-- stays true for the whole frame, on purpose -- it is what lets several
-- widgets read the same pointer without an event queue. The consequence is
-- that a modal opened by a button is opened DURING the frame whose click is
-- still in the buffer, and every modal is drawn after the thing that opened
-- it: the button is outside the modal's rectangle, so the modal's own
-- tap-outside-to-close test reads the opening click as a tap-away and shuts
-- in the frame it went up. On screen it is a flash.
--
-- Every modal in the editor had to solve this and most of them did not. Two
-- carried hand-rolled `_justOpened` flags; four had no guard at all -- the
-- voxel class picker, the profile picker, the wild-encounter picker and the
-- add-a-tileset question -- and every one of them flashed and vanished.
--
-- SO THE GUARD LIVES HERE, and it needs nothing from the caller. A modal is
-- identified by a string; if it did not ask this question on the PREVIOUS
-- frame then this is the frame it went up, and the click in the buffer is the
-- one that opened it. A modal that closes and reopens later gets the guard
-- again for free, because the frames in between are ones it did not ask.
--
-- AND THE CLICK IS SWALLOWED FOR THE REST OF THAT FRAME, which is the half
-- that skipping the outside test does not cover.
--
-- A modal is drawn AFTER the button that opened it and most of them are
-- CENTRED, so the modal lands under a pointer that is still sitting on the
-- button -- and the same click, still in the buffer, is then read by whichever
-- of the modal's own rows happens to be beneath the cursor. From outside that
-- is a popup that "auto-selects what I'm hovering over before I can click
-- anything": the class picker answered itself, the tileset question answered
-- itself, and no amount of guarding the tap-outside test helped, because the
-- click was being taken by a widget INSIDE the modal.
--
-- Clearing `Kit.mouseClicked` here is safe precisely because of the drawing
-- order that caused the problem: everything with a prior claim on this click
-- has already been drawn and has already had it. What is left is the modal
-- that just went up, and it should start the next frame with a clean pointer.

--

-- CHARACTERS. The editor draws cartridge text -- a GB encoding decoded into

--
-- A MULTI-LINE FIELD WITH A CARET, A SELECTION, AND KEYS THAT REPEAT.
--
-- `Kit.textfield` is a one-line box that appends what you type and drops the
-- last character on backspace. For a name or a number that is the whole job.
-- For a line of NPC dialogue it produced three separate complaints, and each
-- one is a different missing piece rather than three views of one:
--
--   * HELD BACKSPACE DID NOTHING. Kit sees a key PRESS; the operating
--     system's own auto-repeat arrives as repeated keypressed events only if
--     the host forwards them, and this one does not. So erasing a sentence
--     meant tapping forty times. Fixed by watching the key's held state
--     ourselves -- `isDown` plus a delay and a rate -- which also makes the
--     behaviour the same on every platform instead of inheriting whatever the
--     OS was set to.
--
--   * ONE LINE, SHOWING THE TAIL. `ellipsizeLeft` keeps the end of the string
--     in view, which is right for a path and wrong for prose: the author could
--     see "...2recomped" and nothing else, with no way to read what they had
--     written. Wrapped over as many lines as the box has room for, scrolled to
--     follow the caret.
--
--   * NO SELECTION. Without one there is no select-all, no cut, no replacing a
--     phrase -- the only edit available was "backspace to it".
--
-- STATE LIVES HERE, KEYED BY ID, because the caller owns the string and hands
-- it over per frame; a caret parked in the caller would have to be threaded
-- through every panel that draws a field. Weak-keyed by nothing -- ids are
-- short strings and there are a handful -- but dropped on blur so a field
-- reopened later starts clean.
-- `atEnd` seeds the caret the first time a field is seen.
--
-- AT THE END, NOT AT ZERO. A field opened on existing text and typed into
-- should extend it; a caret parked at the front means the first character the
-- author types lands before everything they wrote, which is not a behaviour
-- anyone expects from a text box. A click sets the caret from where it landed,
-- so this only decides the case where focus arrived some other way.
