-- Save editor app shell.  Boots the game's generated Data plus a save file
-- and draws the chrome the design spec fixes (SaveEditor.dc.html): a version
-- rail, a title bar, a tab rail and a status bar, with one panel filling the
-- space between.  Panels own their tab's content; this module owns everything
-- around it.
--
-- The editor is reachable two ways and behaves the same in both:
--   * `love . --editor`      standalone window, Close quits
--   * Edit on a launcher save row (main.lua, embedded = true), Close returns
--     to the launcher with the slot list refreshed
--
-- Vertical rhythm (scaled by Kit's height/768 factor, everything else flexes):
--   0    6px   tri-colour version rail, identical to the launcher's
--   6    64px  title bar   identity, file chip, Save / Reload / Open / Close
--   70   66px  tab rail    6 tab tiles + right-aligned validation pill
--   136  flex  content     one panel per tab, 20px gutters
--   -38  38px  status bar  the last Ops message + the keyboard map
