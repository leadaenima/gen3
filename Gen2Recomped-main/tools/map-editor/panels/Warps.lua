-- Warps: the doors between maps, and the maps to put doors into.
--
-- WHY THIS PANEL VALIDATES INSTEAD OF JUST EDITING. A Gen 2 warp is not
-- self-sufficient. `Map:warpAtCell` refuses to return a warp whose cell is not
-- an ENTRANCE collision class ($60, $68, $70-$7F) -- that is how the Ruins of
-- Alph chambers and the Ice Path holes stay shut with their warp_events still
-- in the table. So a warp placed on plain floor is inert: it saves, it loads,
-- it shows up in the list, and the player walks over it forever. There is no
-- error anywhere in that chain. The only place that can be caught is here,
-- before the player goes looking for a bug in the engine, so every warp in the
-- list carries the verdict and the ones that are broken say why.
--
-- The other half of the same problem is the destination. `Warp.destination`
-- has careful fallbacks for a `destWarp` that does not exist -- it lands the
-- player at the destination's way back, then its first warp, then its centre --
-- because Prism's Battle Tower ships exactly that and means it. Those
-- fallbacks are right for cartridge data and wrong as a silent response to a
-- typo, so a dangling destination is flagged here too rather than left to
-- resolve into "somewhere".
--
-- MAKE DOOR copies a door this map already has rather than inventing one. The
-- warp cell's quadrant parity decides which of a block's four collision
-- classes is read, so a block that is a doorway in the top-left cell is a wall
-- in the bottom-right one; and a door block that fits ROUTE_1 looks nothing
-- like a door in a HOUSE. An existing warp on the same map with the same
-- parity is a block that is known to work AND known to look right, which is
-- more than any rule could derive.
--
-- LINK BACK writes the return trip. A door with no door behind it is the most
-- common way a hand-made map traps the player, and it is tedious enough to do
-- by hand (add a warp over there, point it back here, then come back and point
-- this one at its index) that it would mostly not get done.
