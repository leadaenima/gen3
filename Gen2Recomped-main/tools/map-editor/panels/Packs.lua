-- The map packs installed, what each claims, and who wins where they overlap.
--
-- A MODAL RAISED BY IMPORT, not a tool on the drawer rail. Adding a pack and
-- living with the ones already there are the same job -- you press IMPORT to
-- find out what is installed as often as to install something -- and splitting
-- them across a button and a tool meant the list nobody could find was the one
-- that answered "why does this map look wrong".
--
-- WHY ANY OF THIS IS NEEDED. A pack is an ordinary mod and two of them may
-- patch the same map. The registry folds both claims and the last one loaded
-- wins -- a defined answer, but not one anybody chose, and invisible: the only
-- way to discover it was to open the map and not recognise it. Everything
-- shown here is a reading of provenance the registry already kept (see
-- MapPacks); this adds no format and no second source of truth.
--
-- REMOVING A PACK is how the cartridge's own maps come back: with nothing
-- patching a map, the fold is the base value, and the base value is the ROM's.
