-- The map editor's home screen: pick an area, look at it, then choose a tool.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN REUSING THE SAVE EDITOR'S MAP TAB. MapBrowser
-- answers a save's questions -- where is the player, where do they heal, which
-- cell should the spawn move to -- and every one of those needs a save file.
-- The map editor has none, and should not need one: editing New Bark Town's
-- doors has nothing to do with anybody's party. So this is the same idea
-- pointed at the map instead of the player: the overlays are the things that
-- are being EDITED, and the buttons are the tools that edit them.
--
-- The preview is the game's own renderer (MapLoader + TileRenderer), not a
-- schematic. An editor that draws its own approximation of the world teaches
-- you to trust a picture the player will never see -- and the two drift the
-- first time a tileset changes. What is on screen here is what boots.
--
-- Clicking a cell SELECTS it, and the selection is shared with every tool:
-- the WARPS panel adds its next warp there, OBJECTS drops its next NPC there,
-- VOXELS paints there. That is the whole reason to have a preview at all --
-- otherwise every tool needs its own coordinate entry and the map is a number
-- you type rather than a place you point at.
