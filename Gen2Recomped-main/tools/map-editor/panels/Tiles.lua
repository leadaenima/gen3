-- The tile painter: change the ground itself, by dragging on the map.
--
-- WHAT A MAP IS MADE OF, and why this is a block palette rather than a tile
-- one. A Gen 2 map stores ONE BLOCK ID per 32x32 block -- there is no per-tile
-- layer anywhere in the format -- and a block is a 4x4 grid of 8px tiles with
-- four collision classes attached. So the thing you paint with is a block, and
-- the palette is the tileset's own block list: exactly the pieces the
-- cartridge built its towns out of.
--
-- Finer than that is still reachable and still costs a block: repainting one
-- 16px CELL means minting a block that differs from its neighbour in one
-- quadrant, which is what Preview's cell art stepper does. This panel is the
-- coarse tool -- lay a road, fill a room, run a wall -- and the two share the
-- same mint store, so a cell edited one way and a block painted the other do
-- not fight.
--
-- BORROWING FROM ANOTHER TILESET is a different operation and is named
-- differently for that reason. A block's sixteen numbers are indices into ITS
-- tileset's atlas, and the thirty-eight tilesets in a Gen 2 import have
-- thirty-seven different atlases between them -- so the same numbers in
-- another tileset draw whatever happens to be at those indices there, which is
-- not the same picture, it is noise. Bringing art across means copying the
-- PIXELS; see MapEdits.borrowBlock.

-- disagree.  A foreign tileset has no built renderer, so it gets its own bake
-- from the same function the renderer uses -- keyed and cached in there, so
-- flipping through tilesets does not re-bake one twice.

--
-- The palette holds blocks, so the first version painted a block -- and a
-- block is 32x32, four of the 16x16 cells everything else in this editor works
-- in. Two complaints fall straight out of that and they are the same bug: a
-- click painted a 2x2 area rather than the square under the pointer, and it
-- painted it aligned to the BLOCK grid, so clicking the cell at (5,3) repainted
-- cells (4..5, 2..3) -- up and to the left of where the pointer was. Nothing
-- was offset; the tool was simply working in a coarser unit than the one being
-- pointed at.
--
-- So a cell paint mints a block that is the one already there with a single
-- QUADRANT replaced -- the same trick the cell art stepper uses -- and takes
-- that quadrant from the MATCHING corner of the picked block, so painting all
-- four cells of a block by hand reproduces the block exactly.
--
-- The four tile slots of a cell's quadrant, and the collision slot with them.
