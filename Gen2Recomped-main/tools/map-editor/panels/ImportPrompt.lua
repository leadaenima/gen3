-- "This map pack needs these cartridges."
--
-- WHY THIS IS A DIALOG AND NOT A STATUS LINE.
--
-- It was a status line: one row of small text at the foot of the window,
-- saying `installed MAP_EDITS_CRYSTAL - It uses maps from Pokemon Red, which
-- you have imported...`. Everything in it was true and it is the wrong weight
-- for what it says. A map pack that names another cartridge is not
-- self-contained -- it draws its maps out of an import the reader has to keep
-- -- and that is a condition on everything they do with it afterwards, learned
-- once, at install, and never surfaced again. A line that shares the bottom of
-- the screen with "8 x 8 cells - drag to pan" is read as chrome.
--
-- ONE ROW PER CARTRIDGE, ANSWERED INDEPENDENTLY. The interesting case is a
-- pack built from two ROMs where the reader has one of them: told "some
-- cartridges are missing" they go and check both, having already got one. A
-- tick against Red and a cross against Blue is a shorter sentence and a more
-- useful one.
--
-- THE TWO ENDINGS ARE DIFFERENT ADVICE, which is why they are not one string
-- with a word swapped. Present means "keep it -- this is a dependency you now
-- have"; absent means "import it -- until you do, this pack cannot draw". The
-- first is a caution about the future and the second is an instruction for
-- now.
--
-- OVER THE WHOLE WINDOW, painted after the frame, for the reason TilesetPrompt
-- is: Kit has no z-order, so "on top" and "drawn last" are the same sentence.
