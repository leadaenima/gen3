-- Map objects: the NPCs, item balls and trainers standing on a map.
--
-- Plugs into the existing save-editor shell (App.lua's TABS/PANELS) rather than
-- opening a second window. That shell already solves the things a new tool
-- would have to solve again and get wrong: the pad cursor, the console
-- keyboard applet, the modal shield, DPI layout. `MAPS` picks the map; this
-- edits what is on it.
--
-- EVERY CHANGE IS WRITTEN TWICE, on purpose:
--   * into `S.data.maps[id].objects` so the editor (and the map view beside it)
--     shows the change immediately, and
--   * into the MapEdits store, which is what survives.
-- The live table is a rendering of the store, never the other way round -- a
-- reload rebuilds it from the cartridge and re-applies the store on top.
--
-- The list is the CURRENT state (cartridge objects, minus deletions, plus
-- additions), because that is what the player is looking at on the map. Where
-- an entry came from is shown as a tag rather than by splitting the list into
-- three, which would make "the third NPC from the left" impossible to find.

-- Kit arrives as a draw() argument, the way every save-editor panel takes it;
-- requiring it here as well would give the module a second handle on the same
-- table and make it unclear which one a helper is using.

-- { species, level } row with none of that behind it. Sharing the mutation
-- would either corrupt a save mon or need setSpecies to grow a second mode.
-- The valuable half (the catalogue and the fuzzy match) has no such coupling.

-- The palette, for the guidance line under IMPORT A PNG -- "this is advice,
-- not a control" needs a colour that says so.
--
-- GUARDED, because this panel is loaded by harnesses that put only
