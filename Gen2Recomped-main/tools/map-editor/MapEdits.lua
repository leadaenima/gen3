-- The map editor's edit store: a PATCH over the extracted data, never a rewrite.
--
-- THE ONE DESIGN DECISION EVERYTHING ELSE FOLLOWS. Extracted map data is
-- regenerated from the cartridge every time a ROM is (re-)imported -- that is
-- the whole point of the importer, and this session alone has shipped three
-- fixes that only reach a player through a re-import. If the editor wrote its
-- changes INTO data/generated_*, every one of them would be destroyed by the
-- next import, silently, and the player would have no way to tell an edit that
-- was lost from one they never made.
--
-- So edits live in their own file, keyed by version and map, and are applied
-- ON TOP of whatever the current extraction produced. A re-import replaces the
-- base and keeps every edit. The cost is that an edit can go stale -- an object
-- index that no longer exists, a tile outside a resized map -- and `apply`
-- reports those rather than dropping them silently, because an edit the player
-- made and cannot see is the failure mode worth being loud about.
--
-- WHERE IT LIVES: the LOVE save directory, beside options.lua and the saves --
-- not the game folder. Same reasoning as SaveData: the game directory may be
-- read-only (an .app bundle, a packaged .love, a console), and an editor that
-- can only save on some installs is worse than one that saves consistently
-- somewhere findable.

--
-- Keyed by the voxel SOURCE as well as the tileset, because two installed mods
-- disagree about the same tileset on purpose -- that disagreement is what the
-- source selector exists for, and an edit made while looking at one mod's
-- world must not silently reshape the other's.
--
-- These are edits to how a tileset RENDERS, so they live in the tileset bucket

-- map's answer over the tileset's, most specific wins.
--
-- Stored on the map rather than in a second tileset table, because that is
