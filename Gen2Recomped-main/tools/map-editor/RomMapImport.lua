-- Lift one map out of another game you have already imported.
--
-- WHY THIS NO LONGER READS A CARTRIDGE.
--
-- The first cut opened a .gbc through a file picker and parsed it: SHA-1, the
-- manifest, `RomExtractorGen2.new`, `gen2MapIndex` walking every map header,
-- `readSourceTable` loading the scaffold, then an LZ decompression per map.
-- All of that ran inside a draw call, on the frame the button was pressed,
-- behind a native dialog that blocks the loop while it is open. The editor
-- stopped responding, which from outside is a hang -- because it was one.
--
-- And it was work already done. AN IMPORTED GAME HAS ITS MAPS DECODED ON DISK:
-- the importer wrote `<prefix>data/generated/maps.lua` with the block array,
-- the size, the tileset name, the warps and the objects all resolved. Reading
-- that is one `love.filesystem.load` and a `pcall`. No ROM file, no picker, no
-- parsing, no hang.
--
-- So the source is a DROPDOWN OF GAMES ALREADY IMPORTED. A cartridge that has
-- not been imported does not appear -- import it in the launcher and it does,
-- which is the better flow anyway: the import is the step that verifies the
-- dump, and doing it there means it is verified once rather than per use.
--
-- `require` is no use for reading it: `package.loaded` holds the table for THIS
-- version, already mutated by the editor's own overlay.
-- `love.filesystem.load` goes to the file -- the same escape hatch
-- `Data.seedMissingGen2Tilesets` uses to read a sibling version's tilesets
-- without disturbing the loaded one.
--
-- WHAT COMES ACROSS, and what does not.
--
-- EVERY IMPORTED GAME IS OFFERED, Gen 1 and the romhacks included. The gate
-- is the TILESET, not the generation: a Gen 1 map names Gen 1 tilesets, which
-- a Gen 2 build does not have, so it is refused by name -- which tells the
-- reader what is actually wrong, where hiding the game told them nothing.
--
--   blocks     yes -- the decoded block array, as the extractor wrote it
--   size       yes -- width and height, in 32px blocks
--   tileset    by NAME, when this build has a tileset of that name
--   warps      yes, with destinations dropped (see below)
--   objects    yes -- sprite, position, movement, facing
--   encounters no -- a separate dataset, keyed by map id, not on the record
--   scripts    no -- a script is bytecode against THAT game's addresses
--   text       no -- same reason: a pointer into another game's text bank
--
-- The last three are absent rather than approximated. An NPC arriving with
-- somebody else's dialogue pointer says whatever happens to live at that
-- address in YOUR game, which is worse than saying nothing.
--
-- THE TILESET IS THE HONEST DIFFICULTY. A block id means "row N of this
-- tileset's block table", so a map's blocks are only meaningful next to the
-- tileset they were drawn against. Gold, Silver and Crystal share their tileset
-- names and their block tables are near-identical, so a Johto route crosses
-- cleanly. A game that renamed or renumbered its tilesets does not, and this
-- says so at the point of import rather than drawing rubble.

-- Gen 1 and the romhacks are listed too. An earlier cut showed only Gen 2, on

-- has imported tells them nothing, while showing it and refusing the map with
-- "this build has no tileset called X" tells them exactly what is wrong.
--
-- The tileset check is the real gate and it is honest for both. A Gen 1 map
-- names Gen 1 tilesets, which a Gen 2 build does not have, so it is refused by
-- name rather than by generation -- and if somebody DOES have both datasets

--
-- `love.filesystem` is the wrong door for a sibling version's data. The

--
-- WHY A WARP ARRIVED WITH NO DESTINATION, and why that was only half right.
--
-- A warp names its destination by MAP ID and by an INDEX into that map's warp
-- list. Both are the source cartridge's, and at the moment a single map is
-- copied neither is meaningful here: the map on the other end has not been
-- imported, and if a local map happens to share the id it is a different place
-- with the same name. So the import dropped the destination and said so.
--
-- The half that was wrong is that it dropped it FOREVER. Import Cerulean Cave
-- 1F and the stairs down point at CERULEAN_CAVE_2F, which is not here yet;
-- import 2F a minute later and it is -- but the first map's door had already
-- been reduced to a pair of coordinates, with nothing left to say where it had
-- once gone. The reader is then asked to reconnect by hand a link the data
-- knew perfectly well.
--
-- So the destination is REMEMBERED rather than dropped (`destSourceMap` and
-- `destSourceWarp` on the warp) and this runs after every import, over every
-- imported map, in both directions. A door resolves the moment both ends are
-- present, whichever order they arrived in.
--
-- WHAT IT WILL NOT DO. It will not link a Gen 1 map's door to a Gen 2 map that
-- happens to share the id. `ROUTE_1` exists in both and they are different
-- places, and a door that silently lands the player in the wrong game's Route
-- 1 is worse than a door that says it needs a destination. Across generations
-- the only links made are to maps imported from the SAME cartridge, where the
-- id genuinely means the same place. Within a generation -- Gold's maps into
-- Crystal -- a local map of that id is the map, and it is used.

-- The engine's own sentinels, which are not map ids and need no translation.
-- `LAST_MAP` means "back where I came from" and `LAST_WARP` means "back onto
-- the tile I stepped through"; both are resolved at run time by Warp.lua
-- against the player's history, so they work unchanged in any build.
