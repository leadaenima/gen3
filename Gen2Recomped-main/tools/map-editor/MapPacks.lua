-- Living with more than one map pack installed.
--
-- A pack is an ordinary mod -- `ModExport` writes a manifest and a generated
-- main.lua whose MAPS table goes in through `mod.content.maps:patch` -- so two
-- of them editing the same map was never an error. The registry folds both
-- claims in load order and the last one wins, silently, and the only way to
-- find out was to open the map and not recognise it.
--
-- THREE THINGS THIS ADDS, and none of them is a new format:
--
--   * WHICH PACKS ARE INSTALLED, and which maps each one claims. Read from the
--     registry's own provenance rather than by parsing anybody's main.lua: the
--     ops already carry their owner, so this is a question the data can answer
--     without a second source of truth to keep in step.
--   * WHERE THEY OVERLAP, as a list of maps with more than one claimant.
--   * WHICH ONE WINS, per map, stored and reapplied on the next boot.
--
-- REMOVING a pack is `LauncherMods.uninstall` and always was -- the editor
-- simply had no door to it. Uninstalling is what "put the cartridge's own maps
-- back" means: with no pack patching a map, the fold is the base value, which
-- is the ROM's.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------ adding one
--
-- WHY THIS LIVES HERE AND NOT IN THE PANEL. There are two pickers with nothing
-- in common but their purpose.
--
-- `RomImporter.chooseFileByExt` is a NATIVE MODAL -- osascript, PowerShell,
-- zenity -- which blocks and returns a path. On any platform it does not know
-- it falls off the end of its if-chain and returns nil, which is what the
-- editor's IMPORT did on Android: opened nothing, waited for nothing, and
-- reported "no file chosen" for a file nobody was offered.
--
-- The mobile picker cannot work that way at all. It is a separate activity
-- (Android SAF) or a sheet (iOS), the app loses focus, and the pick lands in
-- the save directory seconds later. So `beginAdd` STARTS something and
-- `consumePending` finishes it -- the same two-part shape the launcher's own
-- mod import has always had.
--
-- `picked_mod.zip` is reused rather than a name of this feature's own because
-- the destination basename is chosen natively from a fixed set of kinds
-- (love.system.pickFile); adding one means touching the vendored LÖVE tree.
-- It is consumed and deleted the moment it lands, and the launcher is not
-- polling while the editor is up.
