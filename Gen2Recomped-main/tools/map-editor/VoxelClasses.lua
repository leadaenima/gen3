-- The voxel art classes an override may name, and what each one means.
--
-- ONE LIST, SHARED, BECAUSE THE PANELS HAD DIFFERENT ONES. The Voxels tab
-- built its chooser from the profile's `heights` keys and the preview did the
-- same, which sounds authoritative and is not: `heights` is 28 entries and the
-- vocabulary TileShape actually resolves against is 40. Every class the
-- profile pins by TILE rather than by height -- post, cylinder, grass, canopy,
-- flower, billboard, signpost, stump, shell, rail_face, figures, can, console,
-- prop_bg, prop_ground, mounted -- was simply not offered. Those are not
-- exotic: `post` is every fence in Johto and `grass` is every tuft.
--
-- RESOLUTION ORDER, most authoritative first:
--
--   1. TileShape.CLASS_INFO, if the voxel mod is on the require path. That is
--      the consumer's own table, so a mod that adds a class gets it here with
--      nothing to update.
--   2. This file's table, which mirrors TileShape's FALLBACK_HEIGHTS and ART
--      as of the version it was written against.
--   3. The profile's per-tileset height overrides are layered on top of
--      whichever of those answered, because a tileset entry's `heights` is
--      how the DOJO's 6px tables stop being 12px tables.
--
-- `art` is the fold: how the drawing is applied to the box. It is shown in the
-- editor because it is the difference between a class that stands its artwork
-- upright and one that lays it on top, and picking between `wall` and `roof`
-- without knowing that is guesswork.
