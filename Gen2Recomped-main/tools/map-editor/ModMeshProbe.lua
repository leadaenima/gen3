-- Run a voxel mod's OWN Structures and ChunkMesher, headless, and look at what
-- comes out.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS. There is no LOVE in the sandbox and no way to open the
-- editor, so every change to the voxel contract has been shipped on reasoning
-- alone: read the mod's source, reason about what it does, hope. That is how a
-- height override came to be written, stored, resolved -- and then discarded by
-- a measured run on exactly the tiles anybody wants to adjust, for months,
-- with a green test suite the whole time. The suite was green because it tested
-- a FAKE shape resolver. The real one was never run.
--
-- This runs the real one. A synthetic map, the mod's own modules loaded through
-- `ModShapes` exactly as the editor loads them, and the geometry the mesher
-- actually produces -- vertex count, triangle count, the height range. That is
-- enough to answer the question that matters: DID THE EDIT MOVE THE WORLD.
--
-- IT IS NOT A RENDERER. It does not tell you whether a building looks right; it
-- tells you whether the geometry changed, and by how much in Y. For "does this
-- edit reach the mesher at all" -- the failure this project keeps having -- that
-- is the whole question.
--
-- THE LOVE STUB IS PART OF THE CONTRACT, not a convenience. `ModShapes.readFile`
-- takes the `love.filesystem` path whenever `love` is non-nil, so a harness that
-- sets a partial `love` and no filesystem gets "lib/TileShape.lua is missing" and
-- looks like a broken mod. The stub below provides the three functions the load
-- path actually calls.
