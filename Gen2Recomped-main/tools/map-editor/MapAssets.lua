-- Save a piece of a map and stamp it down somewhere else.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS. A Gen 2 building is not an object in this engine -- it is a
-- patch of block art that the voxel mod's detector reads as a solid and models
-- into a house. Making one by hand means painting twenty cells of facade,
-- roof, door and eaves, and then shaping the heights on top of that, and then
-- doing the whole thing again for the second house. The building already
-- exists on the map next door.
--
-- So an asset is a RECIPE FOR A REGION, not a picture of one: which block and
-- which quadrant of it every cell held, plus the voxel overrides, the objects
-- and the doors that were standing in it. Stamped down, it reproduces all of
-- that at a new origin.
--
-- KEYED RELATIVE TO THE SELECTION'S CORNER, and sparse. Only the cells that
-- were selected are in it, so an L-shaped terrace saves as an L and not as its
-- bounding box with the corner filled in -- and stamping it does not overwrite
-- the ground either side of the L.
--
-- THE TILESET TRAVELS AS A NAME, not as art. Two maps that share a tileset
-- share their block ids, so the common case -- a house from one Johto town
-- onto another -- is a straight copy of numbers. When the destination uses a
-- DIFFERENT tileset those numbers mean different drawings, so the blocks are
-- borrowed across through `MapEdits.borrowBlock`, which appends the source
-- tiles to the destination's atlas and mints blocks that name them. That is
-- the same machinery the tile painter's cross-tileset copy uses.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT IN AN ASSET: scripts and dialogue. An object comes across with
-- its sprite, its position and how it moves; what it SAYS is a text constant
-- belonging to the map it came from, and copying the pointer would make the
-- new NPC recite whatever that constant resolves to on the new map.
