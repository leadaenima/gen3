-- Install a map-edits pack somebody else exported.
--
-- THE OTHER HALF OF `ModExport`, and the reason it needed one: an export that
-- nobody can install is a file, not a feature. The exporter has been able to
-- write a zip for a while and there was no door in the editor to bring one
-- back through, so the only way to check that an export WORKED was to find the
-- file, quit to the launcher and install it as a mod -- which is enough
-- friction that a broken export could sit unnoticed.
--
-- THROUGH THE LAUNCHER'S OWN INSTALLER. `LauncherMods.installZip` already
-- knows how to mount an archive in memory (the Switch refuses to reopen a file
-- it just wrote), find the manifest whether or not the zip has a wrapper
-- folder, refuse a Mac `._` resource fork by its magic bytes, and roll back a
-- half-written tree. None of that is worth a second copy, and a second copy is
-- how the two drift until one of them is the one nobody tests.
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE ADDS is the part the launcher has no opinion about: a map
-- pack can declare the cartridges it needs (`required_games`, see
-- src/import/AdoptedTileset.lua), and installing one whose cartridges are
-- absent produces a mod that loads, refuses, and looks broken. So the
-- requirement is read out of the manifest BEFORE the install and reported
-- with the result.

  -- `installZip` puts the tree on disk and stops there -- enabling is the
  -- launcher's business, and the launcher has a list with a toggle per row.
  -- The map editor has neither. So a pack imported from in here landed
  -- disabled, never loaded, patched nothing, and the pack dialog then said --
  -- correctly, and uselessly -- that no pack was patching any map. The reader
  -- had installed something, been told it installed, and had no way from
  -- where they were standing to make it do anything.
  --
  -- Explicit rather than relying on a default: `options.mods[id]` absent and
  -- `= false` are different states to the launcher, and an import is an
  -- unambiguous statement that this one is wanted.

  -- go and check both, and they already have one.

  -- carries `requiredGames`, so one place decides what a pack declares.
