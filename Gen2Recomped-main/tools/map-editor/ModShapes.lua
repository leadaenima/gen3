-- The voxel mod's OWN shape resolver, run inside the editor.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is the same lesson three times over.
--
-- The 3D viewport used to work out for itself how tall each cell was: it read
-- the profile's class heights, its tile pins and its collision map, and then
-- measured structures with a run scan I wrote by hand. Every one of those was
-- a SECOND implementation of something the mod already does, and a second
-- implementation of a rule is a second answer to it. Where the two differed
-- the editor showed a world the game does not build -- and the differences
-- were not subtle: trees came out as walls, buildings as slabs, and a height
-- set on the voxel tab moved a number in a panel and nothing else.
--
-- So this loads the mod's real lib/TileShape.lua (and lib/Structures.lua when
-- it is there) and asks THEM. The answer is then not "close to" what the game
-- draws; it is what the game draws, by construction, including every
-- conditional pin, hop lip, sealed-cell rule and repeat-aware structure height
-- that has been written into those files -- none of which the editor could
-- ever have reproduced, and all of which it now gets for free.
--
-- HOW A MOD'S MODULES LOAD. They are not on package.path -- a mod directory
-- never is, and may live inside a mounted .love archive -- so they are read as
-- source and given the mod's namespace `V` as their vararg, exactly the way
-- the mod's own main.lua does it (`local V = ...`). `V.require` loads a
-- sibling from lib/, `V.data` a file from data/; both memoise. That is the
-- whole contract those files use, and honouring it is what lets them load
-- unchanged.
--
-- NOTHING HERE IS LOAD-BEARING. A mod may be absent, partially installed, or
-- new enough to need a seam this editor has not got; any of those must leave
-- the viewport working rather than blank. So every entry point is guarded and
-- the reason is KEPT -- `ModShapes.lastError` -- because a caught error thrown
-- away is the single most expensive mistake this codebase has made.

--
-- Mods written against the Gold port's per-generation layout require
-- `src.world.gen2.Map` and friends; src/core/ModCompat.lua maps those onto
-- this engine's own names with a package searcher. In the GAME that searcher
-- is installed by src/mods/Loader.lua before the first mod's main.lua runs --
-- but the editor loads a mod's modules directly and never goes through the
-- loader, so the alias was simply absent.
--
-- The cost of that was invisible and specific: STADIUM2's Structures.lua opens
-- with a bare `require("src.world.gen2.Map")`, so it raised, so `Structures`
-- came back nil, so ChunkMesher (which requires it) never loaded either -- and
-- the editor fell all the way back to drawing its own boxes. A stand of trees
-- that the game builds as 32px hulls came out as one 16px block with the crown
-- and the trunk inside each other, and nothing said why.
--
-- Installed once, at require time, and guarded: an engine without ModCompat is
-- one where no mod needs the alias.

-- `TileShape.lua`, and they drift: the Stadium copy went months without the
-- tile-id pin read, so the editor's ART PIN wrote to a field that mod had no
-- consumer for. Nothing failed. The number moved in the panel, the store saved
-- it, the file reloaded it, and the world was unchanged -- which is
-- indistinguishable from a broken editor, and cost more debugging time this
-- year than any actual bug.
--
-- So the editor MEASURES it: a synthetic one-tile map is put through the mod's
-- own `TileShape.at` with each kind of override on it, and what comes back
-- says which kinds that fork reads. It is a handful of function calls, cached
-- per mod, and it turns "my edits do nothing" from an investigation into a
-- line of text on the panel.
--
-- A PROBE, NOT A VERSION CHECK. A mod's version number says nothing about
-- which fork of a file it shipped, and a fork can gain the read without the
-- number moving. Behaviour is the only thing worth testing.

-- the mod's own GEOMETRY
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- THE LAST STEP OF THE SAME LESSON.
--
-- Asking the mod for each cell's class and height fixed WHAT things are and
-- how tall they stand. It could not fix what they LOOK like, because the
-- editor was still building the geometry itself -- one box per volume, one
-- flat plate per prop -- and the mod does nothing of the sort. A tree canopy
-- is a hull cut from the drawing's own outline and rounded in depth; a
-- staircase is real treads; a bookcase is a collapsed rank with its panes sunk
-- behind their frame; a building's south face folds the artwork upright band
-- by band with the structure's top rows worn on top. None of that is derivable
-- from a height, and every one of them came out as a crate.
--
-- lib/ChunkMesher.lua is the thing that builds all of it, and it has a
-- synchronous, GPU-free entry point -- `geometry` -- that exists for exactly
-- this kind of caller: it returns the vertex and index lists rather than a
-- mesh. So the editor takes those and draws them with its own camera. The
-- picture is then the game's geometry, not a likeness of it.
--
-- Vertices arrive as { x, y, z, u, v, shade }: the same y-up, x/z-ground
-- convention the viewport uses, world pixels, UVs already normalised against
-- the tileset atlas -- which is the same atlas the viewport binds. Indices are
-- 1-based, which is what love.graphics.newMesh's vertex map wants.
--
-- `bodyOnly` is true on purpose. The border ring is the twelve-tile apron of a
-- neighbour's forest the game draws around the edge of the view; in an editor
-- it is scenery around the map you are editing, and it hides the map's own
-- boundary, which is the one thing an editor must show exactly.
