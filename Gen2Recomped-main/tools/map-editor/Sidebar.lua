-- The map editor's tools, as a drawer over the map instead of tabs beside it.
--
-- WHY THIS REPLACED THE TABS. Every one of these tools works ON the map: the
-- warp editor puts a door at the selected cell, the NPC editor drops a person
-- next to it, the voxel editor shapes the ground under it. A tab takes the map
-- off the screen to show you the tool for changing it, so you edit a
-- coordinate, switch back to see what happened, switch again to adjust -- and
-- the one thing you actually need in front of you is the one thing the tab
-- hides. A drawer keeps the map visible and puts the tool beside it, which is
-- what every other level editor does and for this reason.
--
-- MODAL IS LITERAL, and the same shape SpeciesPicker uses because Kit has no
-- z-order. App raises `Kit.blockClicks` over the chrome and the panel while
-- this is open and lowers it only for this layer, so nothing underneath can
-- take the same tap. Getting that wrong does not look like a bug in the
-- drawer: it looks like the map randomly repainting itself when you click a
-- button that happens to sit over a cell.
--
-- The map keeps drawing underneath, unshielded and unscrimmed on the side the
-- drawer does not cover, because seeing the change land is the whole point.

  -- THE BODY SCROLLS.
  --
  -- These panels were written for a full tab -- most of a window tall -- and a
  -- drawer is shorter. The NPC editor is the worst of them: its fields flow
  -- down the column while SAVE, REVERT and DELETE are anchored to the bottom,
  -- so in a short drawer the flow ran straight into them and TRAINER printed
  -- through DELETE. Text over a delete button is not a cosmetic problem.
  --
  -- SCROLLED BY MOVING THE RECTANGLE, not by translating the canvas. The panel
  -- is handed a y above the drawer and a height taller than it, and lays
  -- itself out from those exactly as it always has -- so its hit tests land on
  -- the same coordinates as its drawing, with no transform for the two to
  -- disagree about. A translate would move the pixels and leave Kit testing
  -- the mouse against where the control used to be.
  -- HOW TALL A PAGE THE PANEL GETS.
  --
  -- A constant was a guess, and the guess was wrong in both directions: too
  -- short for the NPC editor with a trainer roster open (SAVE, REVERT and
  -- DELETE flowed below the last field and off the end of the page, reachable
  -- by nothing), too tall for a warp with three fields.  So panels MEASURE
  -- themselves -- `Sidebar.reportHeight`, called at the end of a draw with the
  -- height that draw actually used -- and this is the floor for the first
  -- frame and for any panel that does not report.
  --
  -- ONE FRAME BEHIND, and that is fine: a panel lays itself out from the
  -- rectangle it is handed, so it cannot know its height until it has drawn
  -- one.  The page grows on the next frame and the rail appears with it.
  --
  -- UNLESS THE PANEL FILLS THE BODY ITSELF.
  --
  -- The virtual page assumes a panel FLOWS -- fields down a column, and a page
  -- as tall as the flow. TILES does not: it draws a header and then hands the
  -- whole remaining rectangle to a palette that scrolls INTERNALLY, sizing its
  -- rows and its own rail from the height it was given. Give that a page 780
  -- tall inside a body 600 tall and it lays out 780 worth of swatches, clips
  -- them to the drawer, and believes every row it drew is on screen -- so the
  -- bottom rows are visible-but-cut, its own rail thinks it is at the end, and
  -- there is no way to reach them from either scrollbar. That is the palette
  -- "going past the bottom of the screen".

  -- scroll, no outer rail. Its own scrolling was always the right one.
