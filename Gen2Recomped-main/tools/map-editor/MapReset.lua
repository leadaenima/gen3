-- Put one map back the way the cartridge had it.
--
-- WHY THIS IS NOT `undo` IN A LOOP. Undo walks back through the states this
-- session produced; it cannot reach past the frame the editor opened, and a map
-- edited last week is already at its starting point as far as the stack is
-- concerned. Reset is about the CARTRIDGE's version, which is a different
-- question with a different answer.
--
-- WHY IT IS NOT JUST "DROP THE EDIT BUCKET". Dropping the patches fixes what
-- the NEXT launch builds and leaves this session's map exactly as it was: the
-- tile painter writes `def.blocks` in place, adding an NPC appends to
-- `def.objects`, and `Data:load` laid every stored patch onto the live def at
-- boot. So the live def is not "the original plus a store" -- it IS the edited
-- map, and there is nothing left in memory to subtract the edits from.
--
-- SO THE ORIGINAL IS RE-READ FROM DISK. `require("data.generated.maps")` is no
-- use: `package.loaded` holds the very table that was mutated. `love.filesystem
-- .load` goes to the file, which is the extractor's output and has never been
-- touched by the editor -- the whole point of the patch-store design. That is
-- the same escape hatch `Data.seedMissingGen2Tilesets` uses to read a sibling
-- version's tilesets without disturbing the loaded one.
--
-- A SESSION SNAPSHOT IS THE FALLBACK, not the primary: it is only as old as the
-- moment this editor first drew the map, so on a map edited in a previous
-- session it restores to "how it looked when I opened it", which is not what
-- the button says. Used only when the file cannot be read, and it says so.
