# The SHARED .love packer.  Every platform's build script calls this and only
# this, so a payload can never drift between desktop, Steam Deck, Switch and
# Xbox: scripts/build_linux_arm64.sh, scripts/build_xbox_uwp.sh,
# scripts/switch/verify_payload.sh and scripts/xbox-uwp/selftest_build_xbox_uwp.sh
# are all written against the contract below and were failing outright without
# it (the file was referenced by four scripts and did not exist).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/pack_love.sh --output PATH [--listing PATH] [--version X.Y.Z]
#                        [--dry-run]
#
#   --output   where to write the .love (required)
#   --listing  write the archive's file listing here, one path per line, in
#              the same form `unzip -Z1` prints -- which is what
#              scripts/switch/verify_payload.sh greps
#   --version  stamp this release into src/core/Version.lua INSIDE the archive.
#              The working tree is never touched: the tree carries the version
#              it is building towards and CI restamps the packed copy.
#   --dry-run  accepted for callers that only want the archive and the listing
#              in a scratch directory; nothing outside --output / --listing is
#              written either way, so this is a no-op kept for compatibility
#              with scripts/xbox-uwp/selftest_build_xbox_uwp.sh.
#
# The exclude set below is the SAME set verify_payload.sh rejects, expressed as
# a filter rather than as a test -- pack and verify have to agree or every
# build fails its own gate.  Nothing under data/generated or assets/generated
# ships (that is the player's ROM import), no .gb/.gbc/.sav ever ships, and no
# .bak save backups.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- contents
# Only what the game loads at runtime.  Everything else in the repo -- the
# build scripts, the tools, the tests, the docs, the port projects -- is
# development material and has no business inside a shipped payload.
#
# tools/ is development material EXCEPT two things the game itself loads:
#   * tools/save-editor -- main.lua's own header calls it "part of the
#     shipped app, not a dev-only script"; it puts
#     tools/save-editor/?.lua and tools/save-editor/panels/?.lua on
#     love.filesystem's require path, so a payload without it boots fine and
#     then errors the moment the player presses Edit on a save row.
#     scripts/build.sh has always shipped it; leaving it out of the shared
#     packer silently regressed Switch, Xbox and ARM64.
#   * tools/rom_manifest*.json -- see MANIFEST_GLOB below.
#   * tools/map-editor -- the same argument as save-editor, and it was missed.
#     App.lua loads in "map" mode (main.lua's openMapEditor) and every panel it
#     draws, every store it writes and the mod exporter all live under
#     tools/map-editor. Shipped without it the payload boots, the launcher
#     offers MAP EDITOR, and the require fails the moment it is pressed --
#     and the failures are SILENT where they are pcall'd, which is how the
#     EXPORT button came to be a control that draws and does nothing.

# tools/map-editor is on this list for the reason it was ADDED to CONTENT:
# it was missing, nothing caught it, and the way that surfaced was a button in

# a bug report.
#
# THE PREPACKAGED MOD IS ON THIS LIST for the reason map-editor is: it was
# missing and nothing caught it.  `mods` has been in CONTENT all along, but a
# CI build starts from a clean checkout and `/mods/*` was in .gitignore -- so
# every release quietly staged nothing and shipped a launcher with an empty
# mods panel.  The failure mode of an absent CONTENT entry is one line in a
# build log ("skipping absent mods") and no other sign at all, which is how
# that lasted.  A contract entry turns it into a failed build.
