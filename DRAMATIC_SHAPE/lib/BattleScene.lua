-- Overworld battles: one frame of the arena, as geometry.
--
-- The same world the free-roam mode draws, from a placed camera instead of
-- the orbit, at the WINDOW's own pixel resolution -- not the GB's. The
-- backdrop reaches the screen through Renderer's worldOverride, the seam a
-- render pipeline's finished world image already composites through, which
-- is drawn one canvas pixel to one screen pixel; the 160x144 battle screen
-- then blits over it in the classic letterbox. So the world is as crisp as
-- the free-roam diorama and the pics, HUDs and text box stay exactly the
-- chunky GB art they are.
--
-- Rendering the whole window rather than just the letterbox means the
-- framing has to be split in two. The RIG frames the GB's 160x144 (see
-- BattleCam, which is solved against coordinates in that frame); this
-- module widens the lens by exactly the ratio the window bears to the
-- letterbox, so the letterbox sub-rectangle of what gets rendered is
-- bit-for-bit the framing the rig asked for, and everything outside it is
-- extra picture. That is what lets the two mons be PINNED: their cells
-- project to the same GB coordinates at any window size or zoom.
--
-- Characters are deliberately absent. The overworld cast is culled for the
-- length of the battle (see OverworldBattle), so this pass has terrain,
-- grass and flowers and nothing that walks -- the arena is empty, which is
-- what makes it an arena.
--
-- Everything expensive is shared with the free-roam mode rather than
-- duplicated: the same chunk meshes out of ChunkMesher, the same palette
-- atlas out of TerrainAtlas, the same sun out of ShadowMap. A battle on a
-- map already meshed for walking around costs the frame it draws and
-- nothing else.

-- ------- where the GB frame sits inside the window
--

-- blits the 160x144 UI canvas into a centred, integer-scaled letterbox. So
-- these have to agree with Renderer:endFrame exactly, or the pins land off
-- the mons by however much they disagree.
-- ------- THE SURFACE THE BATTLE IS ACTUALLY LAID OUT IN
--
-- GB_W x GB_H is the Game Boy's screen and it used to be the only answer.  It
-- is not any more: a Gen 3 cache fights on Emerald's own 240x160 surface
-- (src/battle/Gen3Battle.lua), which BattleState:uiSize asks the renderer for
-- and Renderer:endFrame then composites -- letterbox origin
-- floor((p - ui*S)/2) -- in the surface's OWN dimensions.
--
-- Computing that origin from 160x144 while the renderer computes it from
-- 240x160 is the whole of the reported bug.  At 1024x768 the two answers are
-- (192,96) and (32,64): every frosted panel, every snapped HUD band and the
-- text box's glass were placed 160 px right and 32 px down from the thing
-- they were supposed to be under, and the widening in letterboxFov was 1.333
-- instead of 1.200 -- an 11% too-wide lens on top of it.
--
-- So the frame is ASKED FOR rather than assumed, and it is asked of
-- Renderer:uiSize -- the same field endFrame reads -- so the two cannot
-- disagree by construction.  On Gen 1, Gen 2 and Prism uiSize answers
-- 160x144, which is GB_W x GB_H, so every number below is bit-identical.
--
-- NOT a rename of GB_W / GB_H.  Those still mean the Game Boy's frame and
-- there are two places that genuinely want exactly that and must not follow
-- the surface: the billboard TEXTURE canvas (OverworldBattle.texCanvasFor is
-- 160x144 with the pic forced to TEX_AX/TEX_AY, and monMatrix below divides
-- by those same dimensions to hang the card), and the move-animation layer,

-- the copy the renderer finds when that floor is next walked onto or drawn

-- ------- the sun
--
-- Only has to be drawn once per battle: the arena does not move, and neither
-- does the light. So the signature is the map, the arena and the meshes --
-- not the camera, which is the one thing that IS moving and the one thing
-- the sun does not care about.
-- ------- the two mons, hung on their cells
--
-- The billboard texture is the battle screen's own 160x144 pics layer with
-- one side rendered into it (see OverworldBattle.sideTexture), so the quad is
-- that whole frame stood up on the map -- which is what carries every pic
-- effect the engine applies without any of them being reimplemented here.
--
-- Its size follows from one number: a full 7x7-tile mon covers one overworld
-- square, so a canvas pixel is FULL_W / FULL_PIC world pixels and the card is
-- the canvas at that scale. Its placement follows from the anchor the
-- texture reports -- the column the pic was centred on and the row its feet
-- were put on -- which is translated onto the cell before the card is stood
-- up, so a mon of any size in any pose has its feet on the ground.
-- `mirror` flips the card about its own anchor column. Both mons wear their
-- FRONT pic, which is drawn facing out of the screen -- so dropped into the
-- world unaltered the pair stand back to back, both looking the same way past
-- each other. Mirroring the near one turns it to face the far one, which is
-- what a fight looks like; and because it is a flip about the pic's own
-- centre the feet do not move off the tile.
--
-- The player's TRAINER pic is the exception, and it is exempted below. That
-- one is a BACK view -- the player seen from behind, already turned to face
-- up the field -- so it arrives pointing the right way and mirroring it would
-- turn it around to face the camera it is standing in front of.
-- ------- THE CARD IS HUNG FROM THE TEXTURE'S OWN DIMENSIONS
--
-- These four lines used to read GB_W and GB_H, which are the GAME BOY'S
-- SCREEN, while the thing they describe is the BILLBOARD CANVAS
-- (OverworldBattle.texCanvasFor). The two were the same number, and that is
-- the same coincidence g3-viewport-254 was: a size stated in one place and
-- assumed in another, correct only for as long as nobody changes either.
--
-- WHY THIS IS EXACTLY NEUTRAL, and why the mon cannot grow when the canvas
-- does. Work out where a canvas pixel (u, v) lands on the card:
--
--     right = ox + (u/CW - 0.5) * CW*k  =  (u - ax) * k
--     up    = oy + ((CH - v)/CH) * CH*k =  (ay - v) * k
--
-- Neither CW nor CH survives. A canvas pixel is k world pixels wherever it
-- is and whatever size the canvas is; what a bigger canvas buys is more
-- TRANSPARENT MARGIN around the pic, not a bigger pic. So the apparent size
-- of the artwork on screen is a function of the pic's own pixel count and
-- nothing else -- which is the property that lets the canvas follow the
-- layout's surface without the Pokemon changing size.
--
-- `tex.cw` / `tex.ch` are the canvas the pic was actually rendered into (see
-- OverworldBattle.sideTexture); the fallback is the Game Boy frame, which is
-- what every existing caller was assuming.
