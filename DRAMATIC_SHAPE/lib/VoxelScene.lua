-- The void behind the diorama is SKY, at every rung -- so the world reads as
-- standing under something rather than floating on a black plate.
--
-- What is up there differs by rung, and the sky follows it rather than being
-- retuned for each. At 75 degrees the camera is pitched far enough over that
-- the horizon is genuinely in frame, and the bands run down to meet it. At the
-- steeper rungs the horizon is above the top edge and the void that shows is
-- where the ground runs OUT -- past the map edge, past the curve -- so the
-- bands take a fixed slice of the frame instead (lib/Sky.lua, Sky.SPAN) and the
-- haze below them fills the rest.
--
-- INDOORS THERE IS NO SKY. A house, a cave or a gym is a room with a
-- ceiling, and the void past its walls is the outside of a box, not open
-- air. Map.isOutdoor is the same test the engine uses for door SFX and the
-- town map, and the same one Structures already asks to decide whether a
-- map rings with trees.
--
-- The colour is a four-shade ramp shaped like a world palette so the
-- display mode can transform it exactly like one: GRAY gets a grey sky,
-- CLASSIC a green one, GBC INV a dark one, and the colour modes the blue.
-- A hardcoded blue would sit wrong in every non-colour mode -- the same
-- mismatch the terrain bake had.
--
-- This ramp is the FLAT sky -- what a caller clears the void to. The free-roam
-- camera's banded sky has a palette of its own (lib/Sky.lua), transformed the
-- same way by the same seam; they are separate because the flat one also has to

  -- tracks the elevation per entity exactly as the cartridge does, so ask
  -- it: an entity below the bridge's own level stands on the ground the
  -- bridge spans.
  -- A DECK IS THE FLOOR ONLY FOR WHOEVER IS ON IT.
  --

  -- class, because the class does not always say bridge.  Victory Road's
  -- crossings carry no bridge BEHAVIOUR at all -- they are ordinary floor
  -- metatiles whose only statement of "this is a deck" is elevation 15 --

  --
  -- The terrace short-circuit below was added for Mt Chimney's corridor and
  -- it answers `S.synthZ` for ANY walkable cell -- including a deck.  Fortree's
  -- span carries synthZ 32, so every walker there was answered 32 whatever
  -- elevation they arrived with, and the block underneath -- written for
  -- exactly this case -- could never run.  The player walking the street was
  -- lifted onto the planks over their head.
  --
  -- ...AND THE SPAN IS WALKED, NOT PEEKED AT.
  --
  -- The old search looked at the four touching cells only, and the middle of
  -- a MULTI span has MULTI on both sides and the ground it crosses on the
  -- other two: at (31,14) and (32,14) no neighbour is at the walkway's own
  -- level, so the search failed and the fallback answered the DATUM.  A
  -- walker on the deck fell 32px through it.  Measured with the map's
  -- Structures analysis dropped -- which is the state `ChunkMesher.refresh`
  -- leaves it in while the stale mesh keeps drawing, and g3-tier-224's seam
  -- refresh now does that mid-session -- FortreeCity y=14, elev 4:

  --     h    32  32   0   0  32  32
  --
  -- and once `forMap` had rebuilt the cache the terrace answered 32 again.
  -- That is "the bridge where there is a path to walk under it is making me
  -- fall through but then after some time will pop me back up".
  --

-- because with a depth buffer the ring's standing trees would otherwise rise
-- straight through that map's flat ground -- cross into Route 1 and a wall of
-- border trees sprouts over Pallet.
--
-- That set used to be read off `state.neighbors`, the maps the engine loaded
-- around the map the PLAYER is on.  It is the right answer for exactly one
-- map in the frame: the player's.  Every other map drawn beside it needs its
-- OWN surroundings cut out of its OWN ring, and reading the player's would
-- put the holes in the wrong places.
--
-- So ask the engine the same question it asked itself.
-- `OverworldState.computeNeighbors` IS the placement arithmetic that put the
-- neighbours where they are drawn, and run from any map id it answers that
-- map's own neighbourhood, offsets and all.
--
-- TWO HOPS, PLUS THE RING'S OWN REACH, AND NOT THE CAMERA'S.  Two hops
-- because that is what the engine LOADS and draws
-- (`constants.world.neighborHops`, FieldDefaults): a body outside that set
-- is not in the frame, so cutting the ring against it would cut a hole and
-- cover nothing.  But two hops is a graph bound, not a geometric one, and on
-- the water the two come apart -- Ever Grande's ring lies over Route 126,
-- three connections away round the sea -- so the walk is also given the
-- reach below (see masksFor), which is the ring's own 96 px and stops there.
--
-- The CAMERA's reach is the one deliberately left out.  `neighborReach` is
-- half the renderer's view plus 64 px: it changes with the window, and a
-- mask that changes with the window is not a property of the map.  Keeping
-- it out is what lets the mesh, and its disk-cache key (VoxelDiskCache's
-- maskSignature), mean the same thing whether the map is the one under the
-- player's feet or one drawn beside it, so no map is ever re-meshed for
-- having been approached from a different direction, and the full slot
-- becomes as prebakeable as the body one.
--
-- What that costs is bounded and was measured: against the engine's own set
-- there is NO map it fails to mask at the flat renderer's 144x136 reach, nor
-- at 320x240; only past a 512x384 view do six roots pull in nine bodies this
-- does not cut against, and a ring quad over a body that far out is behind
-- the camera's own shoulder.  (Before the ring reach was handed to the walk,
-- that shortfall was 15 entries over 10 roots at EVERY view -- 9,568 ring
-- tiles, 51,654 quads of Petalburg's ring standing over the seabed of
-- Underwater_Route105 and 3,802 of Ever Grande's over Route 126's water.)
--
-- `def.blockPx` and not `tileset.blockTiles * 8`: the same 16 on a Gen 3
-- metatile and the same 32 on a Gen 1/Gen 2 block, but it is the field the
-- engine's own placement reads, so a mask can never disagree with where the
-- body it covers was actually drawn.  (Read as a flat 32, a Hoenn mask came
-- out twice the map's size and suppressed the ring over ground no neighbour
-- covers -- a strip of missing world along every seam.)
--
-- Measured, 81 outdoor maps: of 326,320 ring tiles carrying a shape, 113,800
-- (34.9%) sit under a directly connected body, 126,568 (38.8%) under the
-- two-hop set, and 136,136 (41.7%) once the ring's own reach is added.  The
-- 12,768-tile step from one hop to two is corner ground beyond a neighbour's
-- neighbour -- 3.9% of the ring.  When THIS map is the player's those maps
-- are drawn and the mask is exactly right; when it is a neighbour they may
-- be a hop too far to be loaded, and that corner reads as sky.  It is a

  --
  -- Every neighbour used to be meshed `bodyOnly`: the current map supplies
  -- the ring around the view and a neighbour contributes its body.  That is
  -- the 2D path's shape and on a flat screen it is right, because the flat
  -- renderer tiles the border patch to the edge of the SCREEN and the current
  -- map's ring is the horizon for the whole frame.
  --
  -- A diorama camera sees several map-widths out, and there each neighbour
  -- simply STOPS at its own body edge -- a straight line of town with the sky
  -- behind it.  In-game: stand anywhere on Route 101 and look north at
  -- Oldale, or west from Oldale at Route 102 -- "many of the towns still are
  -- missing their tree borders".
  --
  -- Region-wide, 81 outdoor maps: 190,184 border-ring TILES carry a shape
  -- that no body around them covers -- 47,546 cells of modelled tree wall
  -- that got built for exactly one map per frame.  On the frames themselves,
  -- under POKEPORT_SKY_FLAT: giving every neighbour its own ring turns 50,506
  -- pixels of void into terrain on the Oldale frame and 36,128 on Route
  -- 101's, and turns none of it the other way.
  --
  -- So a neighbour is asked for its FULL mesh, and its own masks do the
  -- asymmetry for nothing: the side facing this map is covered by this map's
  -- body and is cut away, so what actually gets built is the ring on the
  -- sides facing OUT -- which is the only part of it anyone can see.
  --
  -- This is not extra work spread over the walk, it is the SAME work moved
  -- earlier: the full mesh a map needs when you step onto it is now already
  -- built and cached from when it was a neighbour, so a seam crossing costs
  -- nothing where it used to cost a whole rebuild.  A neighbour with no full
  -- mesh yet still draws its body variant if one happens to be cached.
  --
  -- And the same rule as above about a nil answer, with the same reason and
  -- a different remedy: there is no older derivation for a NEIGHBOUR's own
  -- surroundings to fall back to, so a neighbour whose masks cannot be
  -- resolved is meshed exactly as it was before this change -- body only,
  -- no ring.  It loses its horizon, which is the defect this pass fixes; it
  -- does not grow a tree wall through the map the player is standing on,
  -- which would be a worse one.

-- AN OBJECT THE CARTRIDGE NEVER DRAWS IS NOT PART OF THE CAST.
--
-- In-game location: UNDERWATER, THE SEAFLOOR CAVERN BAY -- the submarine
-- EXPLORER 1, cells (5,4) (6,4) (7,4) (8,4).
--
-- The hull is drawn in the MAP ART (Underwater metatiles 736-747, four cells
-- across and three rows deep), and Emerald stands four object events under it
-- so that talking to any of its four cells prints "\"SUBMARINE EXPLORER 1\"
-- is painted on the hull."  All four are graphics id 100 carrying movement
-- type 0x4C, and 0x4C is the cartridge's own HIDDEN type: an object that
-- exists for its collision and its script and is never blitted.  This pass
-- drew all four, so a diver arriving in the bay was met by four copies of a
-- character standing in a row over the sub -- reported as "the submarine
-- shows 4 player characters".  The count is the CARTRIDGE's, not a
-- duplication: four object events, one per cell of a four-cell hull.
--
-- 0x4C is read, not guessed.  Sixteen object events in Hoenn carry it and
-- NINE are the invisible KECLEON -- Fortree City 1, Route 118 2, Route 120 6
-- -- whose shared script opens `checkitem 288`, the DEVON SCOPE, "a device
-- that signals any unseeable POKEMON", and whose reveal movement is literally
-- `set_visible` / `set_invisible` flashing before `setwildbattle`.  The other
-- three are one hidden helper each in Devon Corp 3F, Steven's House and the
-- Mossdeep Space Center.  No other movement type shares 0x4C's step callback.
--
-- The flat 2D pass has always honoured `e.hidden` -- the field a script's
-- set_visible / set_invisible writes -- and this pass never did, which is the
-- same divergence a second time.  Both readings are folded in here, in the
-- cartridge's own order of authority:
--
--   e.hidden == true    a script has hidden it                 -> not drawn
--   e.hidden == false   a script has REVEALED it               -> drawn
--                       (a Kecleon, once the DEVON SCOPE is out)
--   e.hidden == nil     nobody has spoken, so the template's
--                       own movement type answers
--
-- `gen3MovementType` is asked first because `setobjectmovementtype` writes
-- that and leaves the template alone.  A Gen 1, Gen 2 or Prism object carries
-- no `movementType` at all, so this is nil for every one of them and the
-- answer falls back to exactly the `e.hidden` the flat path already gave.

-- ------- THE BERRY PLOTS
--
-- IN-GAME LOCATION: ROUTE 104's berry patch, cells (34,6), (35,6) and (36,6)
-- -- the three plots on the soil strip beside the PRETTY PETAL FLOWER SHOP,
-- which is the frame the report arrived with.  The same three functions cover
-- all 88 of Hoenn's plots.
--
-- Reported from play: "ensure berry trees and sprouts appear as sprites do
-- currently theyre not appearing with voxels on and i just see mounds of
-- dirt".
--
-- THE MOUND IS THE PLOT, NOT THE PLANT.  Emerald marks a berry plot's own
-- cell impassable -- you cannot walk into the tree -- and it is otherwise an
-- ordinary MB_NORMAL cell, so the cell rules read it as a solid mass and
-- stand its drawing up.  Measured over all 518 maps: of the object events
-- that carry the berry tree's graphics row, 87 stand on a cell the shape pass
-- made non-flat -- 48 `cylinder`, 39 `cliff` -- and `buildCylinders` lathes
-- the plot's own dark soil art into a 16px round hull.  That hull, wearing
-- the soil metatile's own two tones at the terrain lighting's two levels, is
-- what the report calls a mound of dirt.
--
-- THE PLANT IS AN OBJECT EVENT STANDING ON THAT SAME CELL.  The mod's own
-- data file has said so from the start -- data/gen3_shapes.lua, at
-- MB_BERRY_TREE_SOIL: "Berry soil is here too: the plant growing in it is an
-- object sprite, not part of the metatile."  And it is not dropped anywhere:
-- measured, every berry tree template in Hoenn carries movement type 12
-- (FACE_DOWN), not 0x4C, so `castHides` answers false for all of them; they
-- are in `state.entities` like every other live NPC; and their card builds.
--
-- What is wrong is WHERE THEIR FEET GO.  `groundAt` answers the floor the
-- hull STANDS ON (the terrace, or the stamp `buildCylinders` recorded under
-- it), not the hull's top, so the card is planted at the BOTTOM of a solid
-- 16px hull that fills its own cell.  A billboard leans back by exactly the
-- camera's pitch (see billboardMatrix), so a 32px card rises only
-- 32*cos(90 - pitch) above its feet: 8px at the 15-degree rung, 18px at 35,
-- 25px at 50.  At every diorama rung below the first-person one the whole
-- card -- minus the sheet's empty top margin, which is the only part that
-- clears -- is inside the mound, and the depth test eats it.  Nothing is
-- hidden, nothing is mis-framed, nothing is at zero scale: it is buried.
--
-- WHY THE MOUND IS LEFT EXACTLY AS IT IS.  It is the SECOND defect here and
-- it is a GEOMETRY defect: a berry plot is flat tilled soil in the cartridge,
-- this mod's own behaviour table already says `[0xA0] = "ground"`, and the
-- cell only reads as a mass because its collision bit is set for the object
-- standing on it.  Correcting that moves shape state on 87 cells, and this
-- round is under a geometry freeze, so it is measured, recorded and refused
-- here rather than smuggled in beside a presentational fix.

-- THE TOP OF THE HULL STANDING ON A CELL, asked of the only thing that
-- knows: the ROUND STAMP the mesher expands there.
--
-- The shape record cannot answer this and it was tried first.  Route 104
-- (3,22) and (22,41) carry byte-identical shapes -- class=cylinder, h=16,
-- base=16, stamp=16, skip=true -- and the mesher draws a hull on one and
-- flat ground on the other, because `buildCylinders` decides which cells get
-- a STAMP and only a stamped cell grows a hull.  Any rule read off `shape.h`
-- plus a class height therefore floats a plant wherever it guesses wrong,
-- and a floating plant is a worse frame than a buried one.
--
-- So this reproduces ChunkMesher's own placement, line for line: the stamp
-- centred on THIS cell, lifted to `my` (the stamp's own base, overridden on
-- a Gen 3 skip cell by the floor painted under it -- the branch whose
-- comment is "a stamp can stand above the floor" and its Mossdeep sequel),
-- plus the tallest y in the stamp's quads.  Verified against the geometry
-- the mesher actually emits, cell by cell, over all 88 berry trees in Hoenn:
-- 48 cells carry a stamp and the prediction equals the measured top on every
-- one of them, exactly; 22 carry none and their measured top already equals
-- what groundAt answers; and 18 stand on a COLUMN rather than a stamp (a
-- cliff face, or a hull anchored on a neighbour) where this answers nil and
-- nothing moves -- named in NOTES as the half this round does not reach.
--
-- CENTRED ON THE CELL, not merely covering it.  A stamp's radius is 16, so
-- its footprint spills into the neighbours: at Route 104 (22,41) the covering
-- set includes the 32px TREE hulls of the row above, and taking their top
-- would stand the plant on a tree.  The centre test is what makes the answer
-- this cell's own drawing.
--
-- Memoised per cell against the Structures analysis (weak-keyed, so a map
-- the cache evicts takes its index with it): the scan is 782 comparisons and
-- one stamp's quads, once per plot, and there are at most a handful of plots
-- in view.

-- The frame this entity's own drawing STATES, as against the one its facing
-- implies.  nil for everybody else, in every generation.
--
-- TWO SOURCES, in the engine's own order of authority:
--
--   1. `e.fixedFrame` -- the engine's published channel for an object that
--      draws ONE sheet row and has no facing at all.  `NPC:draw` branches on
--      it into `SpriteRenderer:drawFixedFrame`, whose own comment says "no
--      facing, no walk cycle... the object's movement data (not its facing)
--      says which one it is, so the ordinary facing math must never touch
--      it".  `NPC:pose` does not return it, so `posesOf` never saw it and
--      `frameFor` -- whose comment promises "the very frame the 2D path would
--      draw (same tables)" -- could only ever answer the facing table.  That
--      is a real divergence for every fixed-frame object, berries aside.
--
--   2. A BERRY TREE'S GROWTH STAGE.  Emerald draws a berry tree from two
--      things, and neither is its facing: a sheet chosen by the BERRY and a
--      frame chosen by the STAGE.  The import records the second of those
--      verbatim -- `constants.gen3Berries.trees.stages[stage]` is the list of
--      frames that stage cycles, read off the tree's own animation table --
--      precisely "so that the step that draws it is mechanical".  This is
--      that step, for this pass.
--
--      Guarded on the sheet actually having frames to choose between: if the
--      engine hands a berry tree a ONE-frame sheet (a per-stage sprite chosen
--      upstream, which `pose()` would already be carrying for both paths),
--      `frames <= 1`, this declines, and `frameFor` answers 0 exactly as it
--      does today.  The two readings can never fight.
--
--      The first frame of the stage, not the second: stages 2..5 sway between
--      two frames on the cartridge's own animation clock, and this pass has
--      no clock for that object.  A still plant, at the right stage.
--      GEN 3 ONLY, and deliberately.  `fixedFrame` is not a Gen 3 field --
--      it is the extractor's row pin for POLISHED's ball/cut/fruit sheet,
--      where a cut tree is frame 1 and a fruit tree frame 2 -- and those
--      objects have the very same divergence in this pass: the flat path
--      blits their stated row and the diorama draws frame 0, the ball.  That
--      is a real defect and it is NOT fixed here, because it is a Gen 2 /
--      Prism behaviour change this round has no way to measure, and the
--      standing rule is that anything outside a Gen 3 arm must be PROVEN
--      neutral for all three.  Recorded in NOTES (g3-orchard-289) so the next

--

-- into the frame, and once into the water's reflection copy (see drawWater --
-- Gen 1 draws people over the world, and water is world, so the cast cannot
-- be composited before the water it has to appear in).
--
-- Characters carry no wireframe out here, whatever the V-GRID row says. The
-- seams are what makes the WORLD read as built out of voxels, and the people
-- walking around in it are the one thing that should read as drawn instead --
-- a grid over a 16x16 sprite lands a line every couple of display pixels and
-- turns a face into a mesh. (The battle pass makes the opposite call for its
-- own combatants, deliberately -- see BattleBillboard.)
--
-- Sprite sheets until the figure pass: their texture coordinates mean

-- ------- the water pass
--
-- Between the terrain and everything that stands on it, because water is a
-- MIRROR and a mirror can only reflect what is already down: the ground, the
-- shoreline, the trees and buildings behind it, and the sky the frame opened
-- with.
--
-- THE CAST IS THE AWKWARD ONE, and it is settled by drawing it twice. Gen 1
-- draws people over the world and water is world, so a surfing player has to
-- composite OVER the water they are sitting on -- which puts them after it,
-- and a reflection can only hold what came before it. So `cast` is painted
-- into the reflection copy alone (Voxel3D.beginWater), where it is in the
-- picture the water reflects and not yet in the picture the water is drawn
-- into. Both draws go through drawCast, so they cannot come out different.
--
-- The ray march finds them the honest way round: a sprite is not in the
-- DEPTH buffer at that point, so a ray aimed at one passes through to the
-- terrain standing behind it and reads the copy there -- where the sprite is
-- already painted. The reflection lands a hair off the sprite's own depth
-- and exactly on its colour, which at a lake's worth of ripple is the same
-- picture.
--
-- `draws` is a list of { mesh, texture, model }. Nothing is a special case:
-- with the row OFF, no depth texture to read, or a shader that would not
-- build, the same meshes go through the ordinary scene shader and come out
-- as the flat animated water this mode always drew.
-- The overworld's alone: the staged battle draws its water plain, always --
-- its placed camera reads this pass wrong, and a stage set wants painted
-- water anyway (see BattleScene, where the choice is argued).
-- ------- and why the flat draw happens FIRST while the world is curved
--
-- The reflective pass writes no depth -- it cannot, the depth canvas is
-- detached for the length of it so the shader can READ it -- and it does its
-- own depth test against that texture instead. That test asks whether
-- something opaque is in front, and it answers correctly for every case but
-- one: WATER IN FRONT OF WATER. Nothing puts water in the depth buffer, so
-- no lake can hide another, and the pass simply paints them in mesh order.
--
-- On a flat world that never matters: every surface lies in the one plane
-- at its own recessed height, and a farther sheet always lands farther down
-- the screen. THE WORLD CURVE ENDS THAT. The bend drops the world by the
-- square of its distance, so the far side of the map swings down and back
-- up into the near field of view -- and a sheet of sea a hundred and fifty
-- tiles away, drawn later in the same mesh, paints straight over the pond
-- at the player's feet. Not a reflection of the far shore: the far shore
-- itself, rasterised on top of the water in front of you.
--
-- So WHILE THE CURVE IS ON, the meshes go down flat first, through the
-- ordinary scene shader with depth writes on, and the reflective pass draws
-- over the top of what survived: the depth buffer now holds the water
-- surface, so the pass's own test throws the far sheet away, and the
-- reflection COPY holds it too, so a ray grazing another part of the lake
-- reads water rather than the void behind it.
--
-- With the curve OFF the prepass is not just unnecessary, it is a LIABILITY,
-- and it stays off -- the reflective pass tests only against terrain, as it
-- always did. Painting the surface into the depth texture turns the pass's
-- test into a comparison of the surface against ITSELF, which asks the two
-- rasterisations to agree to within interpolation error -- and on mobile
-- GPUs they don't reliably (that fight is what put the Android port back on
-- flat water). Confined to the curve there is no regression to reach: the
-- flat world never had the far-shore bug in the first place.
