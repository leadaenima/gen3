-- Voxel world mode: turn a map's tile layer into one static 3D mesh.
--
-- The scene description comes from Structures.lua, which -- 3dSen-style --
-- detects each connected drawn thing on the map and picks its model:
--
--   flat      ground / water / void: a single quad.
--   top art   ledges, roofs (profile-authored): a box with the art on its
--             TOP face; partial side bands crop the art (a 6px ledge face
--             is the bottom of the lip drawing).
--   volume    walls, buildings, tree lines: each column rises to the
--             structure's REAL drawn height (Structures measures it,
--             repeat-aware and region-consistent -- a 6-row house is 48px,
--             a 40-row border forest is rows of 16px trees). The south
--             face folds the full artwork upright, 8px band by band, band
--             k sampling the map row k tiles north; the top wears the
--             structure's top rows.
--   object    small props with a silhouette (plants, signs, lone trees):
--             per-pixel voxel prisms prebuilt by Structures, standing on
--             synthesized ground -- this mesher just emits their quads.
--             Round trees arrive as STAMPS (a shared hull template plus a
--             cell offset) and expand here, straight into the vertex
--             stream, so no map retains per-cell copies of its forests.
--
-- Side faces are never stretched: all sides are 8px bands with the art
-- tiled per band and cropped at partial bands.
--
-- Texturing samples the TILESET ATLAS, not a rendered copy of the map. The
-- atlas is 128x48; a map-space canvas covering the biggest routes would be
-- ~5 MB each with up to five live at once (connected maps), which is real
-- memory on the mobile targets. Sampling the atlas costs 24 KB, and costs
-- nothing in fidelity because TerrainAtlas hands back the same atlas
-- TileRenderer draws with -- including the fully recolored one RED++
-- bakes -- so terrain color comes through untouched.
--
-- BUILDS ARE ASYNCHRONOUS. A frame never blocks on meshing: VoxelScene
-- requests what it wants to draw, request() queues a build job, and
-- pump() -- called once a frame from the pipeline's update -- advances
-- the queue inside a few-millisecond budget (BuildBudget suspends the
-- job's coroutine mid-loop when the slice is spent). Until a mesh lands
-- the scene simply draws without it: the engine's flat path while the
-- current map has nothing, the body-only variant while the full one (the
-- border ring) is still cooking, neighbours popping in as they finish.
-- The synchronous get() remains for probes and tests.
--
-- Meshes are cached per map id and EVICTED down to the live set (current
-- map + connected neighbours) whenever that set changes -- setLive()
-- releases far maps' GPU meshes and their Structures analysis, which is
-- what used to grow the heap by gigabytes over a cross-region trek.

-- allocate twice the size, `ffi.copy` everything across, drop the old one.
-- That is the textbook growable array and it is the wrong shape for this,
-- because of how big "everything" gets. Route 119 emits 2,979,507 quads --
-- six unindexed vertices of six floats each -- which is 429 MB of vertex
-- stream, and reaching it by doubling from 24,576 vertices means ten
-- reallocations whose copies total ~600 MB, with the LAST of them
-- allocating 604 MB while the 302 MB it is copying from is still alive.
--
-- Measured with a tick-gap profiler over the real emit path (the FFI sink,
-- not `geometry`'s table sink): that final grow is a SINGLE UNINTERRUPTIBLE
-- 1,669 ms inside one `push`, which is most of the 4,054 ms worst-case
-- `ChunkMesher.pump` slice the frame instrumentation reported on arriving
-- at Route 119. `Budget.tick` cannot help: there is no yield point inside
-- one `ffi.new` plus one `ffi.copy`.
--
-- So the stream is kept as a LIST OF FIXED BLOCKS instead. Nothing is ever
-- copied to grow, the peak is exactly the stream's own size rather than
-- 2.1x it, the largest single allocation is one block, and a block
-- boundary is a natural place to hand the frame back.
--
-- THE BYTES ARE IDENTICAL. Same order, same floats, same six-vertex

-- uploads the same mesh and `writeRaw` writes the same cache file. That is
-- checked directly: the emitted float stream is hashed before and after.

-- Emit the raw geometry for `map` into `sink`. `bodyOnly` skips the
-- border ring -- the shape the 2D path's drawMapOnly has always had, where
-- only the CURRENT map supplies the ring around the view. In three
-- dimensions EVERY map drawn in the frame carries its own (see
-- VoxelScene.masksFor): a neighbour with no ring stops dead at its body
-- edge with the sky behind it, which on a flat screen is off the side of
-- the picture and in a diorama is the middle of it.
--
-- `masks` (full variant only) lists rectangles, in this map's world
-- pixels, where the BODIES around it sit: ring geometry inside them
-- is suppressed. The 2D renderer never needed this because it painted
-- neighbour bodies OVER the ring; with a depth buffer the ring's standing
-- trees would rise straight through the neighbour's flat ground -- cross
-- into Route 1 and a wall of border trees sprouts over Pallet.
--
-- Kept free of any GPU call so it can be exercised headless -- the
-- geometry is the part with the interesting invariants, and a suite that
-- needed a real GL context to check them would never run in CI.
-- `waterSink`, when given, takes the WATER SURFACE quads instead of the
-- main sink -- the one class in this world that is drawn as its own pass
-- (see Water: a mirror cannot be drawn until what it reflects exists).
-- Nothing else moves: the quads are the same quads, emitted by the same
-- corner and uv arithmetic at the same recessed height, and the shoreline
-- faces around them still belong to the GROUND that exposes them.
--
-- Omitted, water stays in the terrain mesh exactly as it always did, which

  -- WHAT A NEIGHBOUR OCCLUDES IS NOT ALWAYS HOW TALL IT IS.
  --
  -- A face is cut wherever the neighbour is at least as tall, which is right
  -- for a column and wrong for everything drawn as a HULL.  A rock column, a
  -- tree crown, a fence post, a barrel: `buildCylinders` and its siblings
  -- carve those per pixel and they are round, so the ground beside them, told
  -- that the neighbour reaches 48, draws no wall -- and you see past the hull
  -- on both sides of it, straight out of the map.
  --
  -- That is the largest remaining hole in the region and it has been there
  -- from the start.  Route 114's mountain, painted flat magenta so a hole
  -- could be told from a pond (they are the same pixel under a real sky --
  -- Emerald renders water as the sky's own colour), reads 15,800 pixels of
  -- daylight through it, almost all of it beside the pale rock columns of its
  -- north-east flank.
  --
  -- What a hull occludes is its FOOT, because that is the only part of it
  -- that fills its cell.  A stamped cell already answers that way -- its
  -- height IS the ground the stamp stands on -- so this is the same rule
  -- reaching the hulls that were never stamped.
  --
  -- Gen 3 only.  Kanto and Johto draw the same classes, and their ground is
  -- flat, so the wall this uncovers would be zero pixels tall on almost every
  -- tile and a change in vertex count for nothing.

  -- height.  `standGen3Apron` had nonetheless stood that tile up to OUR edge,
  -- so the question "is my neighbour lower than me?" came back "no" on both
  -- sides of every seam in Hoenn and neither map walled the step -- 5,184
  -- pixels of open sky along Route 113's border with Route 112 alone, worst
  -- band 176px.  `Structures.openGen3Seams` marks that one tile line; a face
  -- cut against it runs down to the datum and closes whatever the neighbour
