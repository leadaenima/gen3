-- Dramatic Shape Voxel Mod: a full 3D diorama overworld, shipped as a
-- rendering pipeline mod.
--
-- The engine's render_pipelines registry (src/mods/Schemas.lua) lets a mod
-- own part of the frame.  This mod registers two:
--
--   voxel      a drawWorld pipeline.  Instead of the flat tile blit, the
--              overworld's terrain is extruded into real geometry, walked
--              by a depth-buffered 3D camera, with characters as leaning
--              sprite slabs and a shadow map throwing real cast shadows
--              across whatever they land on.  Occlusion is the depth
--              buffer, not a y-sort: walk behind a building and the
--              building is simply in front.
--
--   tiltshift  a worldPresent pipeline -- the stage that post-processes
--              the finished world BEFORE the UI composites over it.  A
--              tilt-shift blur that sells the miniature-model look, on the
--              diorama only, leaving text boxes and menus crisp.
--
-- Everything a display mode needs beyond the two draw functions -- the
-- OFF/15/35/50 ladder, the options rows, the hotkeys, persistence in
-- save.options.pipelines, the free-roam gate, the mutual exclusion with
-- the engine's TILT mode -- is engine plumbing driven by the records
-- below.  This file declares; lib/ draws.
--
-- Voxel mode is presentational: it changes what the world LOOKS like and
-- nothing about what it IS.  TWO rungs are the deliberate exception. 1ST
-- (the camera in the player's own eyes) and 3RD (the same rig, boomed back
-- behind their shoulder) replace the grid WALK with a free,
-- camera-relative one while either is selected (lib/FreeMove.lua), because
-- a camera you can steer with a mouse demands feet that go where it looks.
-- Even there the game is untouched: the walk asks the engine's own
-- collision the same questions a grid step asks, keeps the player's
-- logical cell synced, and fires the engine's own landing pipeline per
-- cell crossed -- warps, encounters, ledges, gates and scripts all run
-- exactly as themselves. Step off the rung and the grid walk is back.

local mod = ...

-- ------- the mod namespace
--
-- lib/ modules require each other through V rather than package.path: a
-- mod directory is not on it, and may live inside a mounted .love archive
-- that plain require cannot reach.  Each module is loaded once, with V
-- passed in as its vararg (`local V = ...`).

local V = { mod = mod, path = mod.path }
-- ...and the loader's record carries a handle back, so a TEST DRIVER can
-- reach the modules this mod actually loaded.
--
-- `modules` below is a local closed over by `V.require`, and a plain
-- `require("mods.DRAMATIC_SHAPE.lib.X")` cannot reach it -- a mod directory
-- is not on package.path, and the file's `local V = ...` would be handed a
-- module NAME rather than this namespace and raise on the first `V.require`.
-- That is not academic: `tests/drivers/g3_shots.lua` guarded its DAYTIME pin
-- in a pcall, the require raised inside it, and from the day the driver was
-- written until g3-mass-229 SHOT_DAY silently did nothing -- every QA
-- screenshot in NOTES.md was lit by the container's wall clock, and two
-- frames of identical geometry three hours apart differed by half the
-- brightness.  One field, read-only by convention, and a driver can pin the
-- light.
mod.V = V
-- ...and one global, because the record above is not always the one the
-- loader keeps in `loader.loaded` (it hands the entry chunk its own table),
-- so a driver walking the loader finds no namespace at all.  This is a test
-- seam and nothing in lib/ reads it.

-- COMPANION MODULES: present is a bonus, absent is not an error.
--
-- Other mods extend this one by SPLICING requires into its files -- a ceiling
-- for first person, flora, a painted backdrop, a sky layer, a jump. That is a
-- fine way to extend a mod right up until the companion goes away, and then it
-- is a disaster: `V.require` raised, `main.lua` never finished, and the whole
-- of DRAMATIC_SHAPE failed to load with
--
--     FAILED: DRAMATIC SHAPE: lib/Ceiling.lua is missing -- reinstall the mod
--
-- ...over a feature nobody asked for and that had uninstalled ITSELF. The
-- companion had spliced requires into main.lua, VoxelScene, ChunkMesher,
-- Structures and FirstPerson, then removed its own payloads and restored only
-- the files it had backups for -- leaving the splices behind, pointing at
-- files it had just deleted.
--
-- So a companion's module is OPTIONAL by name. Missing, or broken, and the
-- name resolves to an inert table whose every field is a no-op function: the
-- spliced `Ceiling.draw(state)` call sites keep working and draw nothing, and
-- this mod loads. Anything NOT on this list still raises, because a missing
-- lib/ of our own is a real packaging fault and must be loud.
--
-- This is compatibility in one direction only, deliberately. Nothing here
-- requires the companion, references it, or degrades without it.

--   6  T-SHIFT  cycle the blur ladder        (was 9)
--   7  V-CURVE  cycle the horizon bend       (new)
--   8  3D-BTL   toggle overworld battles     (new)
--   9  WATER    cycle the water reflections  (new; 9 was T-SHIFT's old key)
--
-- Only 6 arrives by the documented route. Game:keypressed answers the
-- engine's own display keys FIRST and returns -- 2 COLORS, 3 TILT, 4 ZOOM,
-- 5 GBC FX -- and only then offers the key to Pipelines.hotkey, expressly
-- so "a pipeline can never shadow one" (Schemas, render_pipelines.hotkey).
-- 3 and 5 are two of those, and 7 and 8 belong to plain mod settings that
-- own no pass and so have no registry to claim a key from at all.
--
-- So this wraps Game:keypressed. It is the invasive option and it is the
-- only one: polling the keyboard in update() would fire alongside the
-- engine's handler rather than instead of it, so 3 would cycle this mode
-- AND the engine's TILT on the same press.
--
-- Consequences worth being explicit about: while this mod is enabled, TILT
-- (3) and GBC FX (5) are unreachable by key -- and unreachable on the OPTIONS
-- menu too, where both rows are taken away and both values held at zero (see
-- pinEngineFx). Nothing is being hidden that still does something: TILT is the
-- flat fake of what this mode does for real, the registry already forces it
-- off whenever a world pipeline takes the pass, and GBC FX is a full-screen
-- present pass over the top of the diorama. Uninstalling puts both back.
--
-- Everything the engine does around a pipeline hotkey has to happen here

-- whenever a world pipeline takes the pass. What was left was two rows the
-- player could set and watch get reverted -- TILT is the flat fake of what
-- this mode does for real, and GBC FX is a full-screen present pass over the
-- top of the whole thing.
--
-- So they come OFF the menu, and are HELD at zero rather than merely dropped.
-- Hiding a live setting is a trap: a save written before the mod was installed
-- can carry TILT 3, and a row that is not there is a row that cannot turn it
-- back off. Pinned wherever the value could have arrived from -- the menu
-- opening, a save being loaded or begun -- so there is no route by which one
-- of them is on and unreachable.
--
-- Everything they did is still reachable: uninstall the mod and both rows are
-- back, at whatever they were last set to.
-- BATTLE BG rides the same reasoning, and comes off for a reason of its own.
-- The row picks what fills the screen AROUND the battle's 160x144 field --
-- WHITE paper, BLACK bars, or the frozen overworld dimmed behind it -- and
-- all three were answers to the same question: what to do with the voids,
-- given the battle is a small picture in the middle of a big window.
--
-- This mod answers that question differently and permanently. A staged fight
-- fills the whole window with the map the fight is standing on, and the
-- flat battle screen it composites over it is drawn on the mode's own
-- surface; there are no voids left for the row to fill. WORLD is the worst
-- of the three under it -- it makes the battle non-opaque so the engine
-- draws the overworld underneath, which is a SECOND copy of the world drawn
-- under the one the arena pass already put there, dimmed and at a different
-- camera. BLACK bars over a diorama read as a letterboxed screenshot.
--
-- So the value is pinned at WHITE, which is the one the mode was composed
-- against, and the row comes off the menu on the same reasoning as TILT and
-- GBC FX: a row that no longer decides anything is worse than no row.
-- Uninstall the mod and it is back, at whatever it was last set to.

-- rewrites a block (a cut tree, a smashed rock, a script's replaceBlock)
-- has to drop that map's cached mesh or the 3D world keeps showing the
-- tree that is no longer there.  The 2D tile renderer invalidates its own
-- caches off the same edit.

-- refresh, not invalidate: the stale mesh keeps drawing while the
-- replacement builds in the background, so a one-block edit (Cut, a
-- door stamp, the tree regrowing on re-entry) repopulates in place
-- instead of blinking the whole scene down to the flat 2D path

-- The event above is the ANNOUNCED edit -- OverworldState:replaceBlock
-- emits it, which is the path Victory Road's barriers and a script's
-- replaceBlock take. Several edits do not go through it:
--
--   Cut          swaps the tree block and rebuilds the 2D renderer
--   the regrowth restores those blocks when the map is re-entered
--   card-key doors are stamped closed on floor load
--
-- all of them writing the block layer directly. Meshes derived from that
-- layer went stale with no announcement -- the cut tree stayed standing,
-- and after a round trip through a door the stump stayed cut because this
-- map's mesh survives in the cache (that is what prevLive is for).
--
-- The engine could announce each of those, and an earlier cut of this
-- work changed it to. That is the wrong place: it edits the game for one
-- mod's benefit, and every future path that writes a block has to
-- remember to do the same. They all funnel through ONE choke point --
-- Map:setBlock -- so wrap that from here instead. Map is a plain
-- metatable shared by every map instance, so this covers all of them,
-- including paths written after this mod.
--
-- Read back rather than trust the argument: setBlock silently ignores an
-- out-of-bounds write, and a stamp that rewrites a block with the value
-- it already held (the door code guards for this, the regrowth does not)
-- is not a change and must not throw the mesh away.

-- every palette toggle. Mesh builds are asynchronous, so the frames between
-- the drop and the first finished mesh have no terrain to draw, and

-- ------- battles on the map
--
-- The wraps this needs -- OverworldState:pushBattle, BattleState:draw and
-- BattleState:drawHUDs -- all live in lib/OverworldBattle.lua, which is
-- where the reasoning for each one is written down. Installed once, here,
-- so this file keeps naming every engine seam the mod touches.
OverworldBattle.install()

-- ------- the free-roam rungs' inputs and their walk
--
-- 1ST and 3RD need two things no other rung does, and each is a named seam.
-- Both rungs are one rig -- the boom behind the shoulder is a number inside
-- it (lib/ThirdPerson.lua) -- so both are installed by the same two calls:
--
-- FirstPerson.install claims the LOOK inputs the engine ignores: the right
-- stick's axes (Game:gamepadaxis passes them to Input, which returns early
-- on anything but the left pair), relative mouse motion (love.mousemoved --
-- there is no Game handler to wrap; the engine's own callback only feeds
-- the mouse-as-touch debug path, which stays untouched), the mouse buttons
-- while the cursor is captured (A and B -- there is no cursor to click UI
-- with), and any touch that lands off the overlay's controls (a drag on
-- open screen is the look; the d-pad and buttons still go to
-- TouchControls, whose own d-pad finger is also read back analog as the
-- move vector). Every wrap forwards whatever it does not claim, and claims
-- only while one of the two rungs is actually driving.
--
-- FreeMove.install wraps OverworldState:handleInput -- the one choke point
-- where the grid walk reads the pad, and the same seam the engine's own
-- Cycling Road pull lives behind. While either drives, the walk is continuous
-- and camera-relative; the player's logical cell stays synced and every
-- per-cell consequence still runs through the engine's own machinery
-- (onStepComplete, checkEdgeExit, checkLedgeHop, checkBoulderPush). The
-- file argues the whole arrangement.
FirstPerson.install()
FreeMove.install()

-- ------- the zooms, and the battle camera the player can steer
--
-- CamControl claims the wheel, Q/E, the mouse and the touch screen for
-- whichever camera is actually in front of the player -- the staged
-- battle's, the third-person boom, or the engine's own survey zoom -- and
-- forwards everything else. Installed AFTER the two above deliberately: a
-- wrap installed later is the OUTER one, so a fight gets first refusal on
-- the mouse and the fingers, which is right, because while one is staged
-- the free-roam look is not driving.
CamControl.install()

-- ------- SELECT walks the angle ladder
--
-- The same step the "3" key makes, on the pad's own button: a phone (and
-- a controller) has no number row, and SELECT has no overworld job in
-- Gen 1 -- its work is all in-menu, which this wrap never sees. The seam
-- is OverworldState:handleInput, the same choke point the free walk
-- replaced: every gate above it -- menus, dialogs, scripted moves,
-- transitions -- already decided the overworld owns the buttons, so a
-- SELECT here is free-roam by construction, exactly like the key. When
-- the step is refused (mid-warp, no 3D pass) the press falls through to
-- the engine's own handling, which is a no-op, as ever.
--
-- Gen 2 is the exception: CheckRegisteredItem gives SELECT a real
-- overworld job there, so a live registration wins and the ladder is left
-- to the key, the pad's own binding and the OPTIONS row.  With nothing
-- registered SELECT is idle exactly as in Gen 1, and still steps.
--
-- Installed AFTER FreeMove.install, deliberately: its wrap must sit
-- OUTSIDE the free walk's, or first person -- where FreeMove.tick takes
-- the frame and never calls further in -- would eat the button, and the
-- one rung SELECT could not step off of would be 1ST itself.

-- ------- edge-anchored menus stay in the GB frame while a headset is live
--
-- The engine's zoom-aware anchoring (Renderer:setUIAnchor) docks the START
-- menu to the WINDOW's top-right edge. Both VR screens -- the floating
-- panel and the Pokedex -- crop the window to the GB frame, so a menu at
-- the window's edge is cropped away with the border it docked to. The
-- engine's own answer to "a state composes its screen, keep every element
-- inside it" is uiAnchorHold, computed per frame from this predicate; a
-- live headset is exactly that situation for the WHOLE window, so the
-- predicate answers yes for as long as one is. Held menus blit where they
-- were drawn in the 160x144 canvas -- the START menu's 9,0 x 11 slot is
