# Generation 5 static back sprites

Source reference: [Pokémon Database sprite archive](https://pokemondb.net/sprites)

The importer downloads individual files using the documented asset pattern,
for example `https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/black-white/back-normal/pikachu.png`.

```powershell
python tools/import_black_white_static_back_sprites.py --root .
python tools/import_gen5_extended_normal_sprites.py --root .
```

The first importer writes Kanto. The extension importer preserves those files
and adds Chikorita through Deoxys. Artwork is ignored by Git and is not covered
by the mod's MIT license. Verify that you have the right to use and distribute
it.
